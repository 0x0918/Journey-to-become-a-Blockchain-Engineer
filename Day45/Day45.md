**Hardhat Starter Kit**

[SmartContract](https://github.com/smartcontractkit) comes packed with a ton of starter kits that we can use to start deploying our projects.Let's learn to use the hardhat starter kit so that we can grab the repo and go which already have some boilerplate code and good looking repo to start your projects with.We come to the [hardhat starter kit](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/hardhat-starter-kit) repo, and if you're working with Github, we can just click "Use this template" button and it'll automatically generate you a new Github repo with the hardhat strater kit.

If you don't want to create a repo, you can copy the url and clone it.`git clone *url*` and then open the folder in VScode.

You'll see in the repo, it comes packed with a ton of contracts, deployments, scripts, tasks, tests everything you name it to really get started in a professional environment.If we look in the contract section, we've a couple of sample contracts.We have a contract for making an API call to a chainlink node, working with keepers, working with pricefeed and working with Chainlink VRFV2.We got some test contracts and additionally have fuzzing folder which we'll talk about later.

Once we're in the repo, we can run some familiar commands.We can do `yarn` to install all of our packages.Everything that we're going to do if you get lost, you can always come back to the [repo](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/hardhat-starter-kit) and can follow along with the getting started and the Quickstart.Once we install all the dependencies, we can run `yarn hardhat test`.

So if you're ever looking to start a new project and you want some boilerplate code, hardhat starter kit is a great place to get started.
