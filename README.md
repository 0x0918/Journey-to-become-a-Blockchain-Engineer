## **Blockchain**

**Bitcoin**

`Bitcoin` was one of the first protocol to use this revolutionary technoloy called `Blockchain`.Bitcoin's white paper was released by the sudo anonymous `Santoshi Nakamoto` and it outlined how bitcoin can be used to make peer to peer transactions in a decentralized network.This network is powered by `Cryptography`.It allows people to engage in censorship resistant finance in a decentralized manner.Due to some of the features of bitcoin a lot of people took it as a superior store of value over another asset like gold.That's why it is commonly referred to as digital gold.Similar to gold there's a scarce and set amount of it on the planet and people use it to buy and sell similar to other assets.You can read more about the original vision in the [white paper](https://bitcoinwhitepaper.co/).


**Ethereum**

Some people saw this technology and thought that they could do even more.A few years later a man named `Vitalik Buterin` released a white paper describing a new protocol called Ethereum which used the same blockchain infrastructure but with an additional feature and in 2015 they released this project called `Ethereum`.Him and a number of others co-founders took this blockchain technology and applied it in ways that people can make entirely decentralized applications, decentralized organizations and build smart contracts and engage in agreements without a third-party intermediary or centralized governing force.Their idea was to take the same pieces that made bitcoin great and add smart contracts to it.Technically this was not even a new idea.Back in 1994, a man names Nick Zabo proposed a technology called `Smart Contracts`.


**Smart Contracts**

A Smart Contract is a self executing set of instructions that is executed without a third party intermediary.They come to life on a blockchain and these smart contracts are really going to be a core thing that we're going to be working with and we're going to be developing.Smart contracts are similar to regular traditional contracts that people make between eachother but instead of writing these contracts down on pen and paper or typing that on the computer, it's entirely written in code.The terms of the agreement are written in code and automatically executed by the decentralized blockchain network.This is the main differentiators between the Ethereum protocol and the Bitcoin protocol.


**Bitcoin Vs Ethereum**

Technically Bitcoin also has smart contracts however they're not `touring complete`: they don't have the full range of capabilities as a turing complete application like ethereum.This is actually an intentional move by bitcoin developers.They view the bitcoin network as a asset whereas the ethereum and ethereum developers viewed that asset as an asset and also as a utility for people to build these smart contracts.These smart contracts are revolutionary technologies but they actually come with a fatal flaw with what's know as `The Oracle Problem`.


**Oracle Problem & Solution**

These blockchains are deterministic systems and we'll learn very soon.This determinism means they are a walled guarded meaning that everything that happens in these smart contracts and on this blockchain happens in this little box.Now ofcourse if you want these smart contracts to actually be these digital superior agreements then they need some way to interact with the real world and get real data and external outside the blockchain computation.This is where `oracles` come into play.Oracles are the devices that bring data into a blockchain or execute sometype of external computation.Great so oracles are the solution.Now blockchain can talk to real world right? Well not quite.Our blockchains and smart contracts are these decentralized applications and in order for them to stay decentralized that means they also need to get their data and external computation from a decentralized manner as well.Your on-chain logic will be decentralized on the blockchain but you'll also need your off-chain data and your external computation decentralized as well.


**Hybrid Smart Contracts**

Combining on-chain logic settlement layers and these off-chain data and external computation builds are called `Hybrid Smart Contracts`.A large majority of `defi applications` in the largest applications today are these hybrid smart contracts.This is where protocol chain link comes into play.


**Chainlink**

`Chain link` is a decentralized modular oracle network that allows you to bring data into your smart contracts and do external computation and these hybrids smart contracts can have this on-chain settlement and interact with the real world in some meaningful way.Chain link is an incredibly powerful oracle network because it allows us to get data, get randomness, do some type of update or really customise our smart contracts in any way we want and elevate them to do anything that we want them to do.


**Importance of Ethereum**

Decentralized application is usually a combination of several smart contracts.Smart contracts are going to be what we code, write and deploy for the majority in this lesson.The ethereum protocol has given rise to many new paradigms and industries including `DEFI`, `NTFs`, `DAOs`(decentralized autonomous organizations) , `Layer2` and more.A couple of other protocol have taken this ethereum vision and gone in a different direction with it like polygon, polka dot or avalanche.If we learn the core basics of smart contract development on the ethereum platform all these skills translate to these other chains as well.

There're some smart contracts platform aka blockchains that don't use solidity however learning fundamental skills here will still translate to every single other blockchain.

**Chainlink features**

Chainlink is the most popular and powerful decentralized oracle network and is going to be the one we're going to focus on here.Chainlink is also blockchain and smart contract platform agnostic meaning it'll work on Ethereum, Avalanche, Polygon, Polkadot or really any blockchain or smart contract platform out there.

**Summary**

- Bitcoin was the first one to take blockchain mainstream
- Bitcoin is like a digital gold.
- Ethereum allows for smart contracts.
- Chainlink provides data and external computation to smart contracts.
- Hybrid smart contracts combine on-chain and off-chain computations.


## **Features of blockchain and smart contracts**

**Decentralized**

There's no centralized source that controls the blockchain.The individuals that make up the blockchain are know as `node operators`.They are the independent individuals running the software that connects the whole blockchain together.It's all these different independent individuals that make the blockchain and blockchain like networks decentralized.This is so fundamentally groundbreaking is if you go back to what happened with robinhood and gamestop.Gamestop shares are no longer been allowed to be bought because a centralized entity didn't want them to be bought anymore.So they flipped the switch and nobody could buy that stock anymore.Essentially having a single entity controlling the entire financial market.The fact that single entity has the power to make these choices for us is a travesty and blockchain is here to solve that.There's a narrative here called the bankless narrative where users could actually live in a world where they don't have a bank.Bank while good in their own right have a history of doing some shady things.They also have the power to potentially freeze your funds not letting you withdraw or move or do anything because they are centralized entity that again can flip a switch and control how you interact with your life everyday.Being free of these centralized entities have this much power and this much control over your life has widespread positive remifications.

**Transparency & Flexibility**

Everything that's done on blockchain and all the rules that are made can be seen by everyone.There's no backdoor deals, no shady happenings.This means there's no special information that a few have.Everyone has to play by the same rules and everyone can see what those rules are.Additionally this doesn't mean that everything you do is tracked.The blockchain is `pseudo-anonymous`.So you can create different accounts and can interact with it in many different ways.

**Speed and Efficiency**

Have you ever tried to withdraw from the bank and it took 1-2 hours? All the bank is doing is adding and subtracting  numbers; basic first grade math.So why does it take so long? Because blockchains are verified by a decentralized collective, the settlement or withdrawl period in this case is substantially faster and depending on the blockchain that you're using can be from 10mins all the way down to just a couple of seconds.In the stock trading or hedge fund world, it can actually take upto a week for your buy or sell of a stock to go through.

**Security and Immutability**

Blockchains are `immutable` which means they can't be changed and because of this they can't be tampered with or corrupted in any way shape of form.This allows us to have massive security on our data, transactions and anything of the like.If your computer goes down and your backup computer goes down, in the regular world your data is gone.On a blockchain if several nodes goes down, it doesn't matter because as long as one node and the entire system is running, the data is safe and secure.There are 100's of thousands of nodes running these blockchain software meaning that everything that happens, happens and is immutable and won't change.Hacking the blockchain is nearly impossible and sustantially harder than hacking a centralized entity.This is also much more secure in the asset sense as well.Instead of having a gold in a vault or contract written in a piece of paper or on your computer, you've asset that is locked on blockchain forever and all you need to do to access it is have a private key or mnemonic which is essentially a password.

**Removal of counterparty risk**

Smart contract in particular remove a massive conflict of interest.In the traditional world when we engage with users or individuals, they don't always have our best interests at heart.A lot of them usually self motivated in some sense and there's nothing wrong with that.However when we make an agreement with them, this agreement can have a massive conflict of interest with the user who's supposed to execute that agreement.Let's take insurance for example If I pay an insurance provider 100 dollars a month, I'm paying them a 100 dollars and in the event that I get hit by a bus, we've made an agreement or a contract that they're going to pay my medical bills or bail me out.However they have this massive conflict of interest insurance companies aren't in the business of giving out money, they're in the business of making money.So even though they signed this agreement when this event occurs, they still don't want to pay this money out to me and if they can find the loophole in the contract.They will because that is what they are motivated to do.So they sign this agreement but it's not in the best interest to do so.So they have this massive conflict of interest and this is native in all of the agreements that we make today.They are the ones who decides whether or not they're going to execute their agreement.Giving execution power to the party that doesn't want to execute something that has often led to frustration.Now the follow-up is you can always sue them and go through this process but now you're wasting all this time going through all this long process to get something that you should have originally gotten in the first place.This leads me to one of the biggest value adds to smart contracts.

**Trust Minimized Agreements**

Smart contracts allows us to engage  in trustless and trust minimized agreements.We currently live in a world of brand based agreements.If I engage in some agreement and I don't like the service that I'm provided, my alternative to this is to waltz down the street to another brand to another service who's going to make the exact same set of promises to me and then I have to trust them that they're going to execute faithfully.Smart contracts allow us to move from this brand based agreements to `math based agreements`.These math based agreements we don't even have to trust that they're going to do the right thing.Hence the name trustless.One plus one always going to equal two in a math world.Whatever the code determines is the input/output that's exactly what's gonna happen  every single time.These really all add up to two major pieces : freedom and trustless.All these pieces allows us to live in a world that's more accountable, more trusting, more friendly and just better it allows us to work in an environment and a universe where things just work.It allows us to do the freedom to engage with other people how we wish because there's no centralized controlling body influencing every action that we make.All the rules are the same and nobody's getting special treatment.This bring out the new world of economic oppourtunity as well and as our lives become more and more digital where constantly being bombarded with centralized services that want us to use their interface so they can profit on how we interact and force us or push us to making the decisions that they're motivated for us to make.Smart contracts, decentralized applications and blockchain allows us to be free of these repressors and live in an environment that's truly free and trustless.

**Summary**

- Blockchains are decentralized.They aren't controlled by a single centralized entity.
- Blockchains are transparent.Everything that happens on a blockchain everybody else can see, work with and see that everyone's playing by the same rules. 
- Blockchains are quick and efficient especially when it comes to monetary policy.
- Blockchains can't be changed or tampered with or corrupted and are incredible secure.
- Smart contracts remove massive conflict of interest traditional agreements have.
- Smart contracts allows us to engage in trustless and trust minimized agreements.
- Smart contracts are typically paired with some type of oracle to get the information about the real world.When they're paired with oracle, they're called `Hybrid Smart Contracts`.


**DAOs**

DAOS are organizations that live online and live in the smart contracts.They're similar to regular organization in the traditional world however thay have people who maybe hold governance tokens to make voting decisions or they do all the governance on chain on this decentralized settlement layer giving us the freedom to engage with eachother as we please.


**Ethereum Transaction On a Live  Blockchain**

First thing that we're going to need is an `ethereum wallet`.So go to `metamask` because it's one of the most popular wallet and one of the easiest to use.Download the wallet and it's going to be a little extension in the top right corner of your browser.This way we can really easily see at any time what we have in our wallet.This will store all our ethereum based currencies.Go ahead and install metamask.
