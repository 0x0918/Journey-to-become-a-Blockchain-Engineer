## **Blockchain**

**Bitcoin**

`Bitcoin` was one of the first protocol to use this revolutionary technoloy called `Blockchain`.Bitcoin's white paper was released by the sudo anonymous `Santoshi Nakamoto` and it outlined how bitcoin can be used to make peer to peer transactions in a decentralized network.This network is powered by `Cryptography`.It allows people to engage in censorship resistant finance in a decentralized manner.Due to some of the features of bitcoin a lot of people took it as a superior store of value over another asset like gold.That's why it is commonly referred to as digital gold.Similar to gold there's a scarce and set amount of it on the planet and people use it to buy and sell similar to other assets.You can read more about the original vision in the [white paper](https://bitcoinwhitepaper.co/).


**Ethereum**

Some people saw this technology and thought that they could do even more.A few years later a man named `Vitalik Buterin` released a white paper describing a new protocol called Ethereum which used the same blockchain infrastructure but with an additional feature and in 2015 they released this project called `Ethereum`.Him and a number of others co-founders took this blockchain technology and applied it in ways that people can make entirely decentralized applications, decentralized organizations and build smart contracts and engage in agreements without a third-party intermediary or centralized governing force.Their idea was to take the same pieces that made bitcoin great and add smart contracts to it.Technically this was not even a new idea.Back in 1994, a man names Nick Zabo proposed a technology called `Smart Contracts`.


**Smart Contracts**

A Smart Contract is a self executing set of instructions that is executed without a third party intermediary.They come to life on a blockchain and these smart contracts are really going to be a core thing that we're going to be working with and we're going to be developing.Smart contracts are similar to regular traditional contracts that people make between eachother but instead of writing these contracts down on pen and paper or typing that on the computer, it's entirely written in code.The terms of the agreement are written in code and automatically executed by the decentralized blockchain network.This is the main differentiators between the Ethereum protocol and the Bitcoin protocol.


**Bitcoin Vs Ethereum**

Technically Bitcoin also has smart contracts however they're not `touring complete`: they don't have the full range of capabilities as a turing complete application like ethereum.This is actually an intentional move by bitcoin developers.They view the bitcoin network as a asset whereas the ethereum and ethereum developers viewed that asset as an asset and also as a utility for people to build these smart contracts.These smart contracts are revolutionary technologies but they actually come with a fatal flaw with what's know as `The Oracle Problem`.


**Oracle Problem & Solution**

These blockchains are deterministic systems and we'll learn very soon.This determinism means they are a walled guarded meaning that everything that happens in these smart contracts and on this blockchain happens in this little box.Now ofcourse if you want these smart contracts to actually be these digital superior agreements then they need some way to interact with the real world and get real data and external outside the blockchain computation.This is where `oracles` come into play.Oracles are the devices that bring data into a blockchain or execute sometype of external computation.Great so oracles are the solution.Now blockchain can talk to real world right? Well not quite.Our blockchains and smart contracts are these decentralized applications and in order for them to stay decentralized that means they also need to get their data and external computation from a decentralized manner as well.Your on-chain logic will be decentralized on the blockchain but you'll also need your off-chain data and your external computation decentralized as well.


**Hybrid Smart Contracts**

Combining on-chain logic settlement layers and these off-chain data and external computation builds are called `Hybrid Smart Contracts`.A large majority of `defi applications` in the largest applications today are these hybrid smart contracts.This is where protocol chain link comes into play.


**Chainlink**

`Chain link` is a decentralized modular oracle network that allows you to bring data into your smart contracts and do external computation and these hybrids smart contracts can have this on-chain settlement and interact with the real world in some meaningful way.Chain link is an incredibly powerful oracle network because it allows us to get data, get randomness, do some type of update or really customise our smart contracts in any way we want and elevate them to do anything that we want them to do.


**Importance of Ethereum**

Decentralized application is usually a combination of several smart contracts.Smart contracts are going to be what we code, write and deploy for the majority in this lesson.The ethereum protocol has given rise to many new paradigms and industries including `DEFI`, `NTFs`, `DAOs`(decentralized autonomous organizations) , `Layer2` and more.A couple of other protocol have taken this ethereum vision and gone in a different direction with it like polygon, polka dot or avalanche.If we learn the core basics of smart contract development on the ethereum platform all these skills translate to these other chains as well.

There're some smart contracts platform aka blockchains that don't use solidity however learning fundamental skills here will still translate to every single other blockchain.

**Chainlink features**

Chainlink is the most popular and powerful decentralized oracle network and is going to be the one we're going to focus on here.Chainlink is also blockchain and smart contract platform agnostic meaning it'll work on Ethereum, Avalanche, Polygon, Polkadot or really any blockchain or smart contract platform out there.

**Summary**

- Bitcoin was the first one to take blockchain mainstream
- Bitcoin is like a digital gold.
- Ethereum allows for smart contracts.
- Chainlink provides data and external computation to smart contracts.
- Hybrid smart contracts combine on-chain and off-chain computations.


## **Features of blockchain and smart contracts**

**Decentralized**

There's no centralized source that controls the blockchain.The individuals that make up the blockchain are know as `node operators`.They are the independent individuals running the software that connects the whole blockchain together.It's all these different independent individuals that make the blockchain and blockchain like networks decentralized.This is so fundamentally groundbreaking is if you go back to what happened with robinhood and gamestop.Gamestop shares are no longer been allowed to be bought because a centralized entity didn't want them to be bought anymore.So they flipped the switch and nobody could buy that stock anymore.Essentially having a single entity controlling the entire financial market.The fact that single entity has the power to make these choices for us is a travesty and blockchain is here to solve that.There's a narrative here called the bankless narrative where users could actually live in a world where they don't have a bank.Bank while good in their own right have a history of doing some shady things.They also have the power to potentially freeze your funds not letting you withdraw or move or do anything because they are centralized entity that again can flip a switch and control how you interact with your life everyday.Being free of these centralized entities have this much power and this much control over your life has widespread positive remifications.

**Transparency & Flexibility**

Everything that's done on blockchain and all the rules that are made can be seen by everyone.There's no backdoor deals, no shady happenings.This means there's no special information that a few have.Everyone has to play by the same rules and everyone can see what those rules are.Additionally this doesn't mean that everything you do is tracked.The blockchain is `pseudo-anonymous`.So you can create different accounts and can interact with it in many different ways.

**Speed and Efficiency**

Have you ever tried to withdraw from the bank and it took 1-2 hours? All the bank is doing is adding and subtracting  numbers; basic first grade math.So why does it take so long? Because blockchains are verified by a decentralized collective, the settlement or withdrawl period in this case is substantially faster and depending on the blockchain that you're using can be from 10mins all the way down to just a couple of seconds.In the stock trading or hedge fund world, it can actually take upto a week for your buy or sell of a stock to go through.

**Security and Immutability**

Blockchains are `immutable` which means they can't be changed and because of this they can't be tampered with or corrupted in any way shape of form.This allows us to have massive security on our data, transactions and anything of the like.If your computer goes down and your backup computer goes down, in the regular world your data is gone.On a blockchain if several nodes goes down, it doesn't matter because as long as one node and the entire system is running, the data is safe and secure.There are 100's of thousands of nodes running these blockchain software meaning that everything that happens, happens and is immutable and won't change.Hacking the blockchain is nearly impossible and sustantially harder than hacking a centralized entity.This is also much more secure in the asset sense as well.Instead of having a gold in a vault or contract written in a piece of paper or on your computer, you've asset that is locked on blockchain forever and all you need to do to access it is have a private key or mnemonic which is essentially a password.

**Removal of counterparty risk**

Smart contract in particular remove a massive conflict of interest.In the traditional world when we engage with users or individuals, they don't always have our best interests at heart.A lot of them usually self motivated in some sense and there's nothing wrong with that.However when we make an agreement with them, this agreement can have a massive conflict of interest with the user who's supposed to execute that agreement.Let's take insurance for example If I pay an insurance provider 100 dollars a month, I'm paying them a 100 dollars and in the event that I get hit by a bus, we've made an agreement or a contract that they're going to pay my medical bills or bail me out.However they have this massive conflict of interest insurance companies aren't in the business of giving out money, they're in the business of making money.So even though they signed this agreement when this event occurs, they still don't want to pay this money out to me and if they can find the loophole in the contract.They will because that is what they are motivated to do.So they sign this agreement but it's not in the best interest to do so.So they have this massive conflict of interest and this is native in all of the agreements that we make today.They are the ones who decides whether or not they're going to execute their agreement.Giving execution power to the party that doesn't want to execute something that has often led to frustration.Now the follow-up is you can always sue them and go through this process but now you're wasting all this time going through all this long process to get something that you should have originally gotten in the first place.This leads me to one of the biggest value adds to smart contracts.

**Trust Minimized Agreements**

Smart contracts allows us to engage  in trustless and trust minimized agreements.We currently live in a world of brand based agreements.If I engage in some agreement and I don't like the service that I'm provided, my alternative to this is to waltz down the street to another brand to another service who's going to make the exact same set of promises to me and then I have to trust them that they're going to execute faithfully.Smart contracts allow us to move from this brand based agreements to `math based agreements`.These math based agreements we don't even have to trust that they're going to do the right thing.Hence the name trustless.One plus one always going to equal two in a math world.Whatever the code determines is the input/output that's exactly what's gonna happen  every single time.These really all add up to two major pieces : freedom and trustless.All these pieces allows us to live in a world that's more accountable, more trusting, more friendly and just better it allows us to work in an environment and a universe where things just work.It allows us to do the freedom to engage with other people how we wish because there's no centralized controlling body influencing every action that we make.All the rules are the same and nobody's getting special treatment.This bring out the new world of economic oppourtunity as well and as our lives become more and more digital where constantly being bombarded with centralized services that want us to use their interface so they can profit on how we interact and force us or push us to making the decisions that they're motivated for us to make.Smart contracts, decentralized applications and blockchain allows us to be free of these repressors and live in an environment that's truly free and trustless.

**Summary**

- Blockchains are decentralized.They aren't controlled by a single centralized entity.
- Blockchains are transparent.Everything that happens on a blockchain everybody else can see, work with and see that everyone's playing by the same rules. 
- Blockchains are quick and efficient especially when it comes to monetary policy.
- Blockchains can't be changed or tampered with or corrupted and are incredible secure.
- Smart contracts remove massive conflict of interest traditional agreements have.
- Smart contracts allows us to engage in trustless and trust minimized agreements.
- Smart contracts are typically paired with some type of oracle to get the information about the real world.When they're paired with oracle, they're called `Hybrid Smart Contracts`.


**DAOs**

DAOS are organizations that live online and live in the smart contracts.They're similar to regular organization in the traditional world however thay have people who maybe hold governance tokens to make voting decisions or they do all the governance on chain on this decentralized settlement layer giving us the freedom to engage with eachother as we please.


## **Ethereum Transaction On a Live  Blockchain**

First thing that we're going to need is an `ethereum wallet`.So go to `metamask` because it's one of the most popular wallet and one of the easiest to use.Download the wallet and it's going to be a little extension in the top right corner of your browser.This way we can really easily see at any time what we have in our wallet.This will store all our ethereum based currencies.Go ahead and install metamask.

**Wallet Creation**

![Metamask](/Images/Day1/a1.png)

We're going to create a brand new wallet so go head and hit create wallet.If you already have a wallet, you can actually import it via seed phrase.

![Metamask](/Images/Day1/a2.png)

Now we'll create our password and make sure this is really secure.If you want to use an account and actually put real ethereum and put real money into it, you absolutely need to back it up.

![Metamask](/Images/Day1/a3.png)

This is just a demo however if you show this secret phrase to anybody else they will have access to your all funds.So everything that we're gonna do, we're gonna use fake money.

![Metamask](/Images/Day1/a4.png)

Hit confirm and it gives couple of tips.Remember definitely take the tips seriously especially if you're gonna use the account for real money.

![Metamask](/Images/Day1/a5.png)

We can see the user interface of this wallet and if you look in your extensions, you can pin it in your browser and you can even just click it to get the same interface.

Our mnemonic phrase that secret phrase that we got has given us access to a new account.

![Metamask](/Images/Day1/a6.png)

**Etherscan**

The address of our account, we can use a tool like `etherscan`.

![Metamask](/Images/Day1/a7.png)

So if we look at this address that we just created, we can see that no transactions have happened.It's empty.It has zero ether.It has zero dollars worth of value.Address above is the unique address which represents exclusively the single account that we just created.

**Multiple Accounts**

We can even click the circle and create more account and give it a different account name.

![Metamask](/Images/Day1/a8.png)

Account 2 will have different account address.

**Mnemonic ,  Public & Private keys**

The mnemonic that we've been given gives us access to create multiple accounts with the same mnemonic.So havin that mnemonic will give us access to every single account that's ever created with that mnemonic.This is why securing your mnemonic is so crucial especially if you create multiple different accounts.Each account has a unique identifier with them as well.The account address is the public address.However there's also a private key to work with this account a secret key.We can view it by clicking three dots, go to account details and export private key.

![Metamask](/Images/Day1/a9.png)

This is a single password associated with this account.If you give somebody access to this private key, they'll have access to account 2.They won't have access to my account 1 because private key of account 2 is only associated with account 2.The mnemonic however is associated with all accounts.

**Mnemonic vs Private vs Public keys**

This is why when people say store your keys in safe place, they're referring to both private keys and mnemonic.If you lose your private key, you'll lose access to that account.If you lose your mnemonic you loose access to all your accounts.

**Mainnet & Testnets**

What else is going on in metamask is we can see this section here that says `Ethereum mainnet`.If we click it we can actually see a bunch of other networks in here.

![Metamask](/Images/Day1/a10.png)

When you buy eth and work with eth you're working on the ethereum mainnet.When you interact with smart contracts or defi you're going to be working on mainnet with real value.However since we're engineers oftentimes we're going to want to test our applications or do some type of integration tests or just make sure our code actually works.So there's also test nets.These are networks that resemble ethereum and work exactly the same way as ethereum does however they're not with real money and it's just for testing applications.We can even go to `Rinkeby Etherscan` and see the `Rinkeby Testnet Explorer`, we lookup our address and it's the exact the same information here.

![Metamask](/Images/Day1/a11.png)

Later on we're actually going to show you how to work with other evm compatible chains.Don't worry about evm compatible means for now but we can work with avalanche, polygon and other applications through networks interface as well.

**Initiating our first Transaction**

Infact we're going to make our first transaction on the Rinkeby Testnet and this will simulate exactly what it's like to make the transaction on the ethereum mainnet.

We're going to go to this application called the `Rinkeby Faucet`.This is where we're going to make our first transaction.Rinkeby is going to be one of the two testnets that we're actually gonna work with.The other test net that we're gonna work with is going to be `Coven`.It's important to know how to switch between testnets and evm compatible chains which is why we're going to be working with both.For now we're just be working with Rinkeby.

`Faucet` is a testnet application that gives us free test ethereum.Hence why it has no value because anybody can get it for free from one of these faucets.So to get testnet ethereum with faucet.rinkeby.io, we actually have to post a tweet or a facebook post with the tweet.

![Metamask](/Images/Day1/a12.png)

Now after the tweet we're gonna `copy link to tweet` and place it in Rinkeby Faucet and hit give me ether(18.75 ether/3days).

If we take the account address and go over to Rinkeby Etherscan, we now see the balance is 18.75.

![Metamask](/Images/Day1/a13.png)

But if we look at `Ethereum Mainnet` we've nothing there.We've just made our first transaction.And if we refresh the page, we can also see this is our first transaction that was made.Some account sent us 18.75 ether.We can even look at the details of the transaction.

**Transaction details**

Etherscan is what's known as `Block Explorer`.Block Explorer is an application that allows us to to see details of things that happen on a blockchain easily.We can see the transaction details of the transaction that we made and whenever we work with `Smart Contract` we'll also see them in a transaction similar to what we'll see in a transaction detail.

![Metamask](/Images/Day1/a14.png)

We can see a number of information above.We see a unique `transaction hash`.This hash or unique identifier uniquely identifies this transaction as the key of what this transaction is.

We can see the block number which we can see in a little bit.

We can see from this unique account which is the faucet account.

**Gas fees, Transaction fees, Gas limit, Gas price**

Gas refers to the fee paid to node operators for successfully including a transaction in a blockchain.Now exactly how this works is actually going to change pretty soon but the concept is basically anytime you want to change the state of blockchain wheteher this is a sending some ethereum or making any type of transaction, you actually have to pay a little bit of ethereum or a little bit of that native blockchain token to actually execute that transaction.Whenever we do something on the blockchain,it costs gas and if we do something that would take a lot of energy for the blockchain to do, it will cost more gas.So if I send single transaction that's gonna cost 21000 gas.However if I were to send a transaction that called the smart contract function and did a whole bunch of other stuff, it'd cost more gas.We see here whoever sent us eth also paid the blockchain miners or blockchain validators a little bit of ethereum to include our transaction.We actually get to pick how much of a fee we want to send with our transactions.  

![Metamask](/Images/Day1/a15.png)

**Gas vs Gas price vs Gas Limit vs Transaction fee**

Why would we ever wanna pay more gas price? Why do I even have the option to pay more?

Blockchain can only process so many transactions at a time and nodes and blockchain nodes can only process so many at a time.So when I make a transaction a node has to decide why they want to include my transaction into the block.If there're ton of people looking to make these transactions then the nodes are going to be highly incentivized to pick the transactions that're going to give them a high price that are going to give them alot of money for including that transaction.

**Gas estimator**

In ethgasstation.info, we could get the gas estimator of the blockchain.

![Metamask](/Images/Day1/a16.png)

It currently says that if you wanna get your transaction in right away, it's gonna cost you 81 wei to do so.If you wanna get it in less than 5mins, it's gonna take take you about 62wei.

So the gas price of the ethereum fluctuate with how much people use it and the gas prices of all these blockchains fluctuate with how much people use it.

![Metamask](/Images/Day1/a17.png)

So typically when you're setting your gas price in a transaction, you can take a look-see at your gas station to see the price based on your needs but it all depends on how many people are looking to work with this blcokchain at the same time.

The reason that these gas prices exist is because nodes can only put so many transactions into a block  so they're highly incentivized to input the transactions that are going to give them a higher fee.So in times when alot of people are looking to use a blockchain, prices will get very high and when very few people are using blockchain, prices will be very low.

With just this little bit of information, you now know how to interact with blockchains and interact with ethereum protocol.So if you don't want to learn how to code anything, you can go and you can start interacting with ethereum and interact with protocols with just this information.

Let's look under the hood of ethereum and what is actually going on with these transactions and with these gas and with these blockchains and what's really going on.Let's learn all the fundamentals of a blockchain.

## **How Blockchain works/whats going on Inside the Blockchain**


** Hash or Hashing or SHA256**

Before we get started, we need to take a look at this thing that we call SHA256 hash.Hash looks like bunch of random numbers and it's a fingerprint of some digital data.

hash below starts with `e3b0` which is the hash of nothing.

![Metamask](/Images/Day1/a18.png)

It just so happens it's a fingerprint of whatever I type in this box.If I type the text 'blockchain' into this box, you can see the hash has changed.

![Metamask](/Images/Day1/a19.png)

This is hash of the text 'blockchain' all lowercase which starts with 5318.If I delete the text and type the same text again, it'll have same hash.It's the `digital fingerprint` of the text 'blockchain'.

You could type tons and tons of text and you'd get a hash and the interesting thing about is if there's a tiny amount of information, no information or entire library of congress, you're always gonna get a hash that is this long shown above.You're not gonna be able to pre guess what it is.You'd always get exactly the same hash regardless of how many times you put exactly the same information in.

**Block**

Let's extend the idea of hash into something that we're gonna call block.

![Metamask](/Images/Day1/a20.png)

This is a block and it's exactly like the hash.It's just data section have been broken out into three sections: one called block:this is just some kind of number/block number, a nonce which is just another number and just some more data very similar to the way that we had it before. However the hash this block which includes all of the information up here in above figure which begins with four zeros.It's an relatively unsual hash and most of them are not really going to start with four zeros like the above hash.This one happens to and because it does totally arbitrarily, we can say the block is signed.
        
So what would happen if I were to change any one information in the above block ?

![Metamask](/Images/Day1/a21.png)

The above hash doesn't start with four zeros and the big background has turned red.Now we know this block with this informaton in it is not a valid or a signed block and that's where `Nonce` comes in.This Nonce is just a number that you can set to try to find a number that fits so that the above hash starts with four zeros again.

Above you can see `mine` button.When I click mine button, it's gonna run through all the numbers from 1 all the way up to try find one where the hash starts with four zeros and this process is called mining.

![Metamask](/Images/Day1/a22.png)

It stopped at 64,658 and that one just happens to hash out to something that starts with four zeros and it satisfies little definition of what a `signed block` is.

**Blockchain**

Blockchain is just the chain of these block.How do you put them together? Let's do that.

![Metamask](/Images/Day1/a23.png)

Block number 1 has nonce just like before, there's some data area too but then it has this `Prev` which is a bunch of zeros in first block.

![Metamask](/Images/Day1/a24.png)

The prev is block 2 starts with '0000ae' which is the hash of previous block (block 4).Each block points backwards to the one before it.You remember that the first block, there actually is no previous so it's prev is just a bunch of zeros.It actually just a fake number.

Just like we did before what happens if I change some information in block 5?

It's going to change the hash of this block and it's gonna invalidate it.

![Metamask](/Images/Day1/a25.png)

What would happen if I change something in block 4?

It's going to change the hash but that hash will get copied to the prev hash section of block 5 which change block 5 too.So it should break both blocks.

![Metamask](/Images/Day1/a26.png)

We can go back as far as we want to some point in the past and break that block and it'll break all the blocks since then.Everything before is green.

If I wanted to change something in the blockchian, I could go over to block number 5 and could change it then we could remine it and pick a different nonce.We could essentially alter the change.  

![Metamask](/Images/Day1/a27.png)

What if I go back in past and break block 3? 

![Metamask](/Images/Day1/a28.png)

Now I need to mine block 3 which picks nonce that makes the hash out to four zeros but block 4 and block 5 will still be broken.Although block 3 start with four zeros, adding the four zeros with different stuff in prev section of block 4, still makes the block 4 hash out incorrectly.So I also need to mine block 4 and similarly block 5.

What I wanted to tell is that if I go and change the last block, all I've to do is remine that last block.If I go way back in time to one of the block and make a change, I need to mine from that block.So more block I go by in the past, it's harder and harder to make a change.That's how a blockchain is going to resist mutation/change.

`How do I know that my blockchain has been remined ?`

**Decentralized/Distributed Blockchain**

Let's take a look at `Distributed Blockchain`.

![Metamask](/Images/Day1/a29.png)

![Metamask](/Images/Day1/a30.png)

It looks exactly like the last blockchain but has different peer for the blockchain.You can see peer B having the same blockchain structure like in Peer A.List could go out forever.There's many many peers out on the internet and they all have a complete copy of the blockchain.

If I look at the hash of Peer A block 5, it starts with '0000e4' and If I go down to PeerB block 5, it also has hash that start with '0000e4'.They must be identical.

If I type something on Peer B block 4 and remine block 4 and block 5.

![Metamask](/Images/Day1/a31.png)

All the block in Peer B is green.However the Peer A chain says that last hash start with '0000e4', Peer C says '0000e4' but the middle one says '00004c'.So just by glancing Peer B hash, something is wrong with that Peer B even though all of the hash start with four zeros.Essentially it's two against one.Peer A argues it's '0000e4', Peer B argues it's '00004c' and Peer C argues it's '0000e4'.So '0000e4' wins.So that's how a completely distributed copy having a copy on many different computers they can all very quickly see if all of the blocks are identical.Blockchains can have 400000/500000 blocks very easily so rather than checking through all of them, all you really have to do is to look at the hash of the most recent one and you can that if anything in the past was altered.You can tell by looking at the last block in the chain.


**Tokens/Transaction History**

That's the entire thing.There's no more to it than that but it's kind of not really useful because we don't have something in this data area that means anything I keep typing any text that's sort of irrelevant information.So what we really want is a `token`.Let's do a token on our blockchain.

![Metamask](/Images/Day1/a32.png)

Above tokens are totally arbitrarily which tells 25 dollars from 'Darcy' to 'Bingle'. 4.27 from 'Elizabeth' to 'Jane'.It's basically all the transactions that are happening.Replaced the data with these transactions and just like we saw before there's multiple blocks.It doesn't matter how many transaction there are.If we go down to other peers, we notice we have all these other copies of the same block.Now here's where the immutability is important.If I change something in Peer A block 4, the hash of the last block will be totally different from other peer's last block hash.If I were to go back in time and change some value, we would notice.That's the whole point of using the blockchain to resist any kind of modifications that have happened in the past.

We're not listing 'Darcy' has 100 dollars and she's 25 dollars to 'Bingle'.The only thing we're saying is 'Darcy' gives 25 to 'Bingle'.We're not remembering a bank account balance, only remembering money movements.So this begs the question `"Does Darcy have 25$ ?"`

We've a problem in this version of the blockchain: we don't actually know if Darcy has 25 dollars.So let's look at a `Coinbase` transaction.

![Metamask](/Images/Day1/a33.png)

Coinbase is gonna add a coinbase transaction to our blocks.This is saying that we're going to invest a 100 dollars out of thin air and give it to 'Anders' and there's no transaction in the block because nobody had any money previous to this.

In the next block, another 100 dollars comes out of nowhere and goes to 'Anders'.Now we've transaction and they're all from 'Anders' because 'Anders' is the only one who has any money at the point.'Anders' is sending 10 of his dollars to 'Sophie'.`Do 'Anders' have 10 dollars?` Yes he does because coinbase transaction has given him the 100 dollars.Add all the transaction 'Anders' is sending and they don't go over 100 and it follows sort of a basic rule of a currency that you can't invent it out of thin air, you can't create money out of thin air.It's dispersion is controlled.

![Metamask](/Images/Day1/a34.png)

If we look at this blockchain that we've created and zip forward in time and we notice that 'Jackson' is giving 'Alexa' 2 dollars.Does Jackson have 2 dollars? We go back a block before and see that 'Emily' had gotten 10 dollars from 'Andres' gave 10 to 'Jackson'.So 'Jackson' does have the money.That's actually one of the benefit's of having a previous in the block.It's easy to go backwards.


**Summary**

- Ethereum actually runs on Keccak256.
- Hash is a unique fixed length string to identify a piece of data.
- Hash algorithm is a function that computes data into a unique hash.
- Mining is the process of finding a "solution" to the blockchain "problem".
- Nodes get paid for mining blocks.
- Block is a list of transactions mined together.
- Blockchains are decentralized and distributed because many independent users are going to run this blockchain software and they'll check and compare against eachother to see which blockchains are acting honestly and which ones are acting maliciously.
- Nonce is a "number used once" to find the "solution" to the blockchain problem.
- Nonce is also used to define the transaction number for an account/address.


## **Signing and Verifying a Transaction**

We're going to talk about signing the transactions, private keys and some other cryptography bacause in the blockchain below we see fantastc transactions but how do we know that it was Darcy who was the one to send 25 dollars to Bingley.How do we know that actually happened?This is where all those pieces that we just learned about in our test net in our metamask account are really going to come to life .

![Transaction](/Images/Day2/b1.png)

**Public & Private Keys**

Here we've an example of public and private keys.

![Public_Private_Key](/Images/Day2/b2.png)

Private key: Only Known to the Key holder, it's used to "sign" transactions.
    
You really wanna keep secret because you're going to be using this as a kind of your secret password for all the transactions .

I can really pick any private key I want with this `Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm` for ethereum and bitcoin they both use this elliptic curve digital signature algorithm.It's a variant of the digital signature algorithm and It's going to create it's public key.

That public key we want everybody to have access to right.Whole world can see this public key.

We're going to use the private key as like a password to quote/unquote digitally signed transaction and then people can verify them with this public key.

Let's see what this actually look likes

**Signatures**

If we go to signatures tab and let's say we have this message that we want let's say "hi world"

What's going to happen is the private key that we created, we can use to sign this data(hi world).We're using digital signature algorithm to create this message signature.

![Message_Signature](/Images/Day2/b3.png)

What's really powerful about how this algorithm works is that you can create this message signature with your private key but somebody else can't derive your private key from the message signature.This is what makes this really really powerful.

However if we go to verify using our public key, anybody can verify that the signature is yours.

![Message_Verification](/Images/Day2/b4.png)


**Transactions**

If somebody try to fake a transaction, they need to verify their's signature against my public key and very easily it turns red cause it's not verified.

We can take that into transactions into exact same way.

![Transaction_verification](/Images/Day2/b5.png)

If I wanna send 20 dollars from my account to another account using my private key, I can sign that transactions and anybody else in the world could verify the transactions.This is why people say to protect your keys.

Your Ethereum address is actually a piece of your public key.To get our address to ethereum all we have to do is take this public key we've created with our private key, hash it using that same ethereum hashing algorithm and take the last 20 bytes and that's how we'll actually derive to our address.

Knowing the exact methodology of how to get the address doesn't really matter because it could change blockchain to blockchain but just know that's essentially how kind of these addresses are derived.

Note : This isn't how we send the transaction.So this is just going to sign it, create a transaction for us to send.We'll learn later on how to send these transactions.


## **Concepts are same**

Now we know all the cryptography pieces and all the little nitty grittes of how the blockchain actually works and how our signatures work and how everything sticks together.Let's talk a little bit about how this works in actuality and what's really going on.

For alot of this each different blockchain has slightly different algorithms, metrics and criteria for doing alot of this stuff.So when we're talking about specific implementations keep in mind the exact algorithm might be little different but the concepts are all still gonna be exactly the same.Hashing and hash function is going to be same no matter where you look.A decentralized blockchain is going to be same no matter where you look.How it's actually implemented is a little bit different.

Traditionally when you run an application you know be it as a website or something that connects to some server, you're interacting with a centralized entity and unlike how we saw with the blockchain with multiple different peers.It's going to be run by a single centralized group.It still could be run on many different servers but all those servers are still going to be controlled by the same centralized group.Blockchain as we saw run on a network of independent nodes.When we saw peerA, peerB, peerc and more, those were different examples of different independent users running the blockchain technology on their node.

**Node**

Node here means single instance of a decentralized system.When I say single node,when I'm talking about a blockchain, talking about one of those peerA's peerB's and so on running that blockhain software.I'm talking about one server running this technology and again it's the network it's this combination of these nodes interacting with eachother that creates this entire blockchain.What makes these so potent too is that anybody can join the network and that's why they're decentralized.The barrier to entry is a little bit of hardware requirements.Anybody can join these networks and participate and that's what make it truly decentralized.In fact you can go to github right now and run your ethereum node in a few seconds.

**Centralized entity vs  Decentralized Blockchain**

In the traditional world applications are run by centralized entities and if that entity goes down or is maliciously bribed or decides they wanna shut off they just can because they're the ones that control everything.

Blockchain by contrast don't have this problem.If one node or one entity that runs several nodes goes down since there're so many independent nodes running that it doesn't matter.The blockchain and the system will persist so long as there is atleast one node always running.Luckily for us most of the popular chains like bitcoin and ethereum have thousands and thousands of nodes.As we've showed in our demo if one nodes acts maliciously, all the other nodes will ignore that node and kick that out or even punish it in some systems because they can easily check everybody else's node and see this one is out of sync with the majority and yes majority rules when it comes to blockchain.

**Transactions are Listed**

Each blockchain keeps a full list of every transaction and interaction that's happened on that blockchain and we saw if a node tries to act maliciously then all their hashes are going to be way out of whack and they're not going to match anybody else.This gives the blockchain incredibly potent immutabilty trait where nothing can be changed or corrupted.

So in essence we can think of a blockchain as a decentralized database and with ethereum it has an extra additional feature where it also can do computation in a decentralized manner.

**Consensus**

When we went through that blockchain example and we did that mining feature this is what's known as `proof of work`.Proof of work and proof of stake fall under the umbrella of consensus amd consensus is a really important topic when it comes to blockchain.

Consensus is defines as the mechanism used to reach an agreement on the state or a single value on the blockchain especially in a decentralized system.I briefly alluded to this consensus mechanism in our blockchain example when I said if one changes something and the other two don't then majority will rule and kick that one out.This is part of that concensus mechanism.

Now very roughly a consensus protocol in a blockchain can be broken down into two pieces.
- `Chain Selection Algorithm`
- `Sybil Resistance mechanism` 

**Proof of Work/Sybil resistance mechanism**

That mining piece we're doing or the proof of work algorithm is what's known as a sybil resistance mechanism and this is what ethereum and bitcoin currently use.Proof of work is known as a sybil resistance mechanism because it defines a way to figure out who is the block author: which node is going to be the node who did the work to find that mine and be the author of the block so all the other nodes could verify that it's accurate.

### **Sybil Resistance**

Sybil Resistance is a blockchain's ability to defend against users creating a large number of pseudo-anonymous identities to gain a disproportionately advantageous influence over said system and in laymen's term it's basically a way for blockchain to defend aganst somebody making a fake nodes so that they can get more and more rewards.

There are two types of sybil resistance that we're gonna talk about here namely POW (Proof of Work) and POS (Proof of Stake).

### **POW**

In POW this is sybil resistant because a single node has to go through a very computationally expensive process called mining which we demonstrated earlier to figure out the answer to the blockchain's riddle of finding that correct nonce.

In POW this works because no matter how many pseudo-anonymous accounts you make each one still has to undergo this very computationally expensive activity of finding the answer to the proof-of-work problem which again in our demonstration it was finding a nonce with that first four zeros but each blockchain might change the riddle or change the problem to be little bit different.

**Blocktime**

In fact some of these blockchain make this riddle intentionally hard or intentionally easy to change what's called block time.The block time is how long it takes between blocks being published and it's proportional to how hard these algorithms are.So these problems can actually change depending on how long they want the block time to be.

If the system want the block time to be very very long they just make the problem very very hard and viceversa.We'll ralk about civil attacks in a little bit and how they can affect the system but with proof of work it's a verifiable way to figure out who the block author is and be civil resistant.

**Chain selection rule**

Now you need to combine this with the chain selection rule create this consensus.There are some consensus protocols that have more features but very very roughly there are two pieces that we're going to look at.The second piece is going to be chain selection rule.How do we know which blockchain is actually the real blockchain and the true blockchain?

**Nakamoto consensus**

On Bitcoin and Ethereum they both use a form of consensus called `Nakamoto Consensus` and this is a combination of POW and longest chain rule.The decentralized network decides that whichever blockchain has the longest chain or the most number of blocks on it is going to be the chain that they use.This makes lot of sense because every additional block that a chain is behind it's going to take more and more computation for it to come up.That's why we saw on our transaction we actually saw confirmations.

**Block Confirmations**

The number of confirmations is the number of additional blocks added on after our transaction went through in a block.So if we see confirmations is two it it means the block that our transactions was in has two blocks ahead of it in the longest chain.Now I do wanna point out that a lot of people use POW as a consensus protocol and I do wanna say that this is a little bit inaccurate but sometimes people use it interchangeably.POW is a piece of overall consensus protocol which in bitcoin and ethereum  one's current case is nakamoto consensus.


**Block rewards & transaction fees**

`This has recently changed as of EIP 1559`.
POW also tells us where these transaction fees and these block rewards go to.Remember how we made this transaction we had to talk about gas and a transaction fee.So who's getting paid? Who's getting this transaction and this transaction fee is going to the miners or validators?

In a POW network they're called miners and in POS they're called validators.There are little bit different and we'll get into that when we talk about POS.

In this POW system all these nodes are competing against eachother to find the answer to the blockchain riddle.Remember in our example it has to find hash that has four zeros at the start and again depending on the blockchain implementation that riddle is going to be a little bit different.

But all the nodes are trying as many as possible to try to get this answer first why because the first node to figure out the answer to the blockchain rule is going to get that transaction fee.They're going to get paid from that.

When a node get's paid they actually gets paid in two different ways.One is going to be with a transaction fee and another piece is going to be the block reward.

 - **Transaction fees**

Remember we talked about alternating the gas price that's the transaction fee that we're gonna pay to these blockchain nodes for including our transaction.The block reward is given to the nodes from the protocol from the blockchain itself.

 - **Block Reward**

You've probably heard of the bitcoin halving before.The halving is referring to this block reward getting cut in half and it's supposed to be cut in half roughly every four years.This block reward increases the circulation amount of whatever cryptocurrency that is being rewarded.For example on ethereum the block reward is giving out ethereum and on bitcoin it's giving out bitcoin.

So these nodes are competing against eachother to be the first one to find this transaction to be the first one to find the answer to this problem so that they can be the ones to win both this block reward and your transaction fee.Some blockchain like bitcoin for example has a set time when they're no longer going to give out block rewards and the mminers or the nodes are only going to get paid from transaction fees.

Gas fees are paid by whoever initialized the transaction.When we got our funds from the faucet there were some server and somebody else was paying the transaction fee for us.However we send ether from one account to another our first account actually paid some transaction fee to send that ether.

In POS there's also a gas fee but it's paid out to validators instead of miners and we'll talk about that in a little bit.

Now let's talk about two types of attack that can happen in this blockchain worlds.


**Sybil attack**

The Sybil Attack is when a user creates a whole bunch of pseudo-anonymous accounts to try to influence a network.Now obviously on bitcoin and ethereum this is really really difficult because the user needs to do all these work in POW or have a ton of collateral in proof of stake which again we'll talk about in a little bit.


**51% attack**

As we saw as part of our consensus protocol these blockchains are going to agree that the longest chain is the one that they're going to go with so long as it matches up with 51% of the rest of the network.This means that if you have the longest chain and you've more than 51% of the rest of the network you can do whats called a fork in the network and bring in the network onto your now longest chain.

Sybil attacks obviously are when a single node or a single entity tries to affect the decentrality of the network by pretending to be multiple different people although they're just the same person or entity and like I said it's really difficult to do in POW and POS.

### Longest Chain Rule

Now you can see that blockchains are very democratic.Whichever blockchain has the most buy-in and is the longest is the blockchain that the whole system is going to corroborate.When nodes produce a new block and add to the longest chain the other nodes will follow this longest chain that the rest of the network is agreeing with add those blocks to their chain and follow up.So very small reorganizations are actually pretty common when a blockchain picks a block from a different longest chain puts it on and then has to swap it out for another block and continue with the different blockchain.

However if a group of nodes had enough nodes or enough power they could essentially be 51% of the network and influence the network in whatever direction they wanted.This is what known as 51% attack.This happened on blockchains like Ethereum Classic which is not Ethereum.This is why the bigger a blockchain is the more decentralized and the more secure it becomes.


**Drawbacks of pow**

POW is fantastic because it allows us to very easily protect against these sybil attacks and keep our blockchains decentralized and secure.However it has some drawbacks as well.POW costs a lot of electricity because every single node is running aa fast as they can to win this race to get the rewards.This leads to obviously an environmental impact.Since POW and Nakamoto Consensus a lot of other protocols have taken this idea and gone in a different direction with a different sybil resistance protocol.Alot of them with the intention to be alot more environmentally friendly and the most popular one rn is POS.

**proof of stake/sybil resistance mechanism**

There are some chains that are already using this Proof of Stake protocol and that are live and thriving.Some of them are like `avalanche`, `solana`, `polygon`, `polkadot` and `terra` and additionally ethereum has decided to upgrade to eth2 which will have this proof of stake algorithm as well.

It's a different sybil resistant mechanism instead of solving this difficult problem POS nodes put up some collateral that they're going to behave honestly aka they stake.In the example of ethereum 2 nodes put up some ethereum as a stake they're going to behave honestly in the network.

If they misbehave to the network they're going to be slashed or removed some of their stake.Obviously this is a very good sybil resistance mechanism because if you try to create a whole bunch of anonymous accounts then each one of those accounts you have to put up some stake and if you misbehave you're going to run the risk of loosing all the money that you put up as collateral.


**Validators**

In POS miners are actually called `validators` because they're no longer mining anything.They're actually just validating other nodes.Unlike POW which every node is racing to be the first one to find the block in POS nodes are randomly chosen to propose the new block and then the rest of the validators will validate if that node has porposed the block honestly.

As you saw with our cryptography lesson it's usually very easy for other nodes to verify if a proposal or a transaction is honest.

### Randomness

It's a really important topic when we're talking about blockchains because keep in mind these blockchains are deterministics systems.They're walled garded from the rest of the world and as you know a deterministic system by definition can't have random numbers.So how do we choose the random validators in the system?

Well it changes from blockchain to blockchain and actually choosing the node will change blockchain to blockchain but in eth2 they're using what's called randow at least for the original implementation.This is a decentralized autonomous organization that collectively chooses the random number and collectively chooses which node is going to run next.


**pros & cons of pos**

POS obviously has some pros and cons as well.

Pros are that again it's a great sybil resistance mechanism and a great way to figure out who the author of a block should be and the other pros are that it's way less computationally expensive to figure out new block because instead of every single node on the network trying to do this only one node needs to do this and the rest of the nodes just need to be validate.

Cons are that it's usually considered a slightly less descentralized network due to the upfront staking costs, it costs to participate.This gets into a little bit of a philosophical battle on how decentralized is decentralized enough and I think it's upto the community to decide and as we progress I think we'll learn more and more about how decentralized is decentralized enough.The general consensus among blockchain engineers though is that POS is very very decentralized and very secure.This massive environmental impact improvement is one of the two main reasons why eth is shifting to eth2.It reduces the environment impact by upto 99%.


**Scalability problem & Sharding solution**

- Scalability

When we're talking about gas prices we're saying that the gas prices can get really high if a lot of people want to send a transaction because a block only has so much block space and the nodes can only add so many transactions.So when alot of people wanna use blockchain the gas price skyrockets.This is not very scalable because we wanna add more and more people to these blockchains it's going to cost more and more to use the blockchains because more people are going to want to get into blocks.This means that there's kind of a ceiling to how many people can use the system because of the financial constraints will get imposed as gas prices keep rising. Eth2 is not only attacking the environmental impact of POW by switching to POS but they're also implementing this new methodology called `Sharding`.

- Sharding

Sharding is a solution to this scalability problem.A sharding blockchain really just means that it's going to be a blockchain of blockchains.There's a main chain that's going to coordinate  everything amongst several chains that hook into this main chain.This means that there's more chains for people to make transactions on effectively increasing the amount of blockspace that there is.Sharding can greatly increase the number of transactions on a blockchain layer1.There's another term that might be the first time you've heard it's a layer1.


**Layer 1 & Layer 2**

Layerr1 refers to any base layer blockchain implementation.Bitcoin's,Ethereum and Avalanche a layer1.These are base layer blockchain solutions.

A layer2 is any application that is added on top of layer1;added on top of blockchain.Some examples of layer2 are going to be chainlink, arbitrum or optimism.Arbitrum and optimism are very interesting because they're layer2s that also look to solve the scalability issue.They are known as `Rollups`.


**Rollups**

Arbitrum and Optimism roll up their transaction into a layer1 like ethereum.We're not gonna go to deep into rollups and how they actually work but all you really need to know is that a rollup is kind of like a `shraded chain`.They derive their security from the base layer from the layer1 like ethereum and they bulk send their transactions onto the layer1.They solve some of the scalability issues by being another blockchain that people can make transactions on still on kind of base ethereum layer.Now they're different from `side chains` because side chains derive their security from their own protocols.Rollups derive their security from the base layers.So arbitrum and optisium for example is going to be just about as secure as ethereum.



**Summary**

- BTC and ETH are both Proof-of-Work blockchains that follow Nakamoto Consensus.
- ETH2 will be a Proof-of-Stake shraded blockchain.
- Sybil attacks are prevented due to protocols like POW & POS.
- 51% attack grows increasingly harder with the size of blockchain.
- Consensus is how blockchains decide what the state of the chain is.
- Sharding and rollups are solution to scalability issues on layer1's.
- A layer1 is any base blockchain implementation like bitcoin or ethereum.
- A blockchain scalability problem is that there's not enough block space for the amount of transactions that want to get in them which leads to very high gas price.
- Gas prices are how much it costs to interact with a blockchain.


## **Remix IDE & its features**

Welcome to the [remix ide](https://remix.ethereum.org).

![remix_ide](/Images/Day3/c1.png)

This is where we start to work with solidity, smart contracts and deploy it to blockchains.

There's a bunch of solidity plugins like solidity, learneth, solhinthinter and more.But we're going to go ahead with solidity.We're going to create a little application that can store information on the blockchain for us.So we're going to create new file (.sol)

Solidity's compiler tab (Eth looking like on the tab) which compiles all the solidity code down to machine understandable code or machine language.Here's whole bunch of parameters we can choose when working with solidity like compiler version, choose the language, evm version.So let's code our first solidity contract.

We're going to use something a little bit special here when we deploy the code. We're going to use `JavaScript VM` which simulates actually deploying to a test net or a real network.We're not actually going to deploy on a real network.We'll in a little bit but just to get started we're going to work with JavaScript VM which is kind of a fake environment for now.

Testing locally and understanding how to test locally will make your coding experience a lot faster as you saw when we sent some transactions, some of them actually took a lot of time to actually deploy.We don't want to have to spend that much time waiting around for our tests to actually finish. 


**Solidity version**

The first thing that you gonna need in any solidity program is the solidity version.That's always going to be at the top of your solidity code.It is defined by:

![pragma_version1](/Images/Day3/c2.png)

Ctrl + s will save and "compile".

If we want a specific version of solidity, we could also do:

But for this if we just hit ctrl + s it'll try to compile on previous compiler version.This might give error.You need to click the "Compile" button for compiler automatically switch to the specific compiler version.

![pragma_verision2](/Images/Day3/c3.png)

We can also do:

`pragma solidity ^0.6.0;`

which allows us to work with any version of 0.6.

We'll be working with compiler version 0.6.0.However in future contracts that we work with we're actually going to work with different versions of solidity.The reason we're going to be changing versions throught the journey is that solidity is constantly updating language,being good at switching between versions is going to make you an incredibly powerful smart contract engineer.


**Defining a  Contract**

To define our contract:
![solidity_contracts](/Images/Day3/c4.png)

`contract` is a keyword in solidity.You can think of contract similar to a class in Java or any other OOP language.Here "SimpleStorage" is the name of the contract.

You could hypothetically deploy this right now and this would be a valid contract.

**Variable types & Declaration**

In solidity there're many different types that we can work with.Let's go into some of the types of solidity we can have.

![variable_types](/Images/Day3/c5.png)

You can also do:

`uint x = 5;`

But if you want to be little more precise, alot of protocols and smart contracts will do whole name like `uint256`.

We can also do bytes1, bytes2 upto bytes32.

**Solidity Documentation**

If you wanna learn more about the different types and the different variables that you can use, head over to the [solidity documentation](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.11/).

**Initializing**

Even if I didn't manually inilialize to 5, it'll get initialize to a null value.For now let's just not initialized it to anything that way it'll get automatically initialized to zero.This means when we deploy this contract as of right now, x will start off as zero.

**Functions or methods**

Functions or methods are self contained modules that will execute some task for us and in solidity it's the exact same thing they're defined by:
![functions](/Images/Day3/c6.png)

This is in simplest form of how you can define a function.This functions set's whatever value(whole number) we pass to the age. 


**Deploying a Contract**

So let's go ahead and actually deploy this contract to actually interact with it.

If we hit eth looking button, which will bring us to the deploy tab and will allow us to deploy our smart contract.

![deploy_contract1](/Images/Day3/c7.png)

Using our JavaScript VM it's given us fake accout with some ethereum in it.It has a 100 ethereum in it to start and same as before anytime we want to interact with the blockchain we have to pay a little bit of gas even in our fake virtual machine here.We want to simulate that so you'll see it has some of the same parameters here as making a transaction like gas limit for example.

When we deploy a contract, it's going to cost a little bit of ethereum or a little bit of gas to do so.Let's go ahead and click deploy button.

![deploy_contract2](/Images/Day3/c8.png)

We can look at all the transactions we've recorded.We can see it says "Deployed Contracts" and we've our contract.

In this SimpleStorage Contract we see this big store button because there's one public function that we can actually interact with.So we can add 25 there, we hit store and look at our contract that we've paid little bit more gas to interact with the function.

Anytime we want to make a state change in the blockchain we've to pay a little bit of gas.The reason metamask isn't popping up is because we're kind of doing it in this simulated environment.

**Public , Internal , private , External Visibility**

This is great however it looks like we can't actually see what out age is.We can't actually look at it.So how do we actually make sure that we can view the age?

If we add public to our age, we recompile, delete our previous contract and redeploy and we can see button's pop up.

![redeploy1](/Images/Day3/c9.png)
![redeploy2](/Images/Day3/c10.png)

Let's talk about why this public variable allowed us to see this new button this age button?

This `public` keyword defines the visibility of the variable or the function.There are currently four different types of visibility.
- External: 
External function means it can't be called by the same contract.It has to be called by an external contract.
- Public:
Public functions can be called by anybody including variables.Oddly enough variables are a function call to just look at them and return whatever that variable is. 
- Internal:
Internal functions can only be called by other functions inside of it's existing contract or in it's derived contract.
- Private:
Private is the most restricitive as private functions and state variables are only visible for contracts they are defined in and not derived contracts.

The reason that we didn't see age in our original contract deployment is that if we don't give a state variable a visibility, it'll automatically get set to "internal".

**Modifying a Variable**

If we hit age button, it shows the value  of age is 0.The store function is set so that whatever value(whole number) we pass it, it's going to change age to the value we pass it as.

If we pass 5, hit store, that transaction goes through and then the age we can see the value is now 5.

I'll be using transactions, smart contract interactions and function calls a little bit 
interchangeably.That's because on a blockchain whenever you call a function or whatever you make some state change to the blockchain you're actually also making a transaction.That's what makes this whole thing powerful and again that's why making a function call or deploying a contract costs a little bit of gas.

**Scope**

The reason we can access this age variable inside store function is because age has this `global` or `contract` scope.If we make a variable inside store function, we'd not be able to access it outside of a store function because it's self-contained inside the brackets`{}`.

**View functions**

You can also make a function called retrieve and make it a public function that is of type view and returns uint256.All this is going to do is return favorite number.

![retrieve_function](/Images/Day3/c11.png)

![deployed_retrieve](/Images/Day3/c12.png)

Question: "Why store function has orange color and other two has blue? "

The key relies in view function or view keyword.There are two special keyword that define functions that you actually don't  have to make a transaction on.Those keywords are view and pure.

**View functions**

A view function means that we want to read some state off the blockchain.We're just reading off the blockchain.If we're reading off the blockchain and we're not actually making state change then we don't need to make a transaction.These `blue buttons` are blue because they're view functions.Public variables also have view functions that's why both of these are blue.Age variable is technically a view function.When I click it, I get to view the state of the variable.

**Pure functions**

A pure functions are functions that purely do some type of math.

![pure_function](/Images/Day3/c13.png)

We're doing some type of math above but we're not actually saving state anywhere.It's also going to have blue color button.

So for now let's remove public keyword from age variable and work only with retrieve function.

**Structs**

This application is great so far for it allows a single person to store a age and then retrieve it.But if we want a list of people or a group of people and store their age or what if we want to associate a age with a single person?

We've a whole number of different choices but the one we're going to talk about is using a struct. 

Struct are ways to define new types in solidity.They're almost like creating new objects.

![struct](/Images/Day3/c14.png)

We've a new type of people that has a favorite number and a name inside of it.Now what we could do with struct is :

![struct_init](/Images/Day3/c15.png)

Let's deploy this contract and see what it looks like:

![struct_deployed](/Images/Day3/c16.png)

We've Humans struct which at 0th index is the age and 1st index is the name.

**Intro to Storage**

Storing variables in solidity always works in above numeric index fashion.In fact contract simple storage uint256 age is at index 0.

**Arrays**

Instead of just creating one person, we actually want to create a whole list of humans(boys in this case).So how do we create list of people?

Array is a way of storing list or a group of some object.

![dynamic_array](/Images/Day3/c17.png)

**Dynamic Array**

The array we created above is a dynamic array.It's a dynamic array cause it change it's size.Right now it's of size 0 and if we add something to it, it's of size one.

**Fixed Array**

![fixed_array](/Images/Day3/c18.png)

This array could only have a maximum of one boy inside of it.

We're going to work with dynamic array because we want to add an arbitrary number of boys into.

**Adding to an array**

Let's go and create a new function called add boy.

![struct_array](/Images/Day3/c19.png)

We can see our new function addBoys where we pass a string memory name and a uint256 age.Then we create a Humans object and we push it onto our boys array.

**Memory**

In solidity there's more or less two ways to store information.You can store it in memory or in storage.

When you store an object in memory, it actually means that it'll only be stored during execution of the function or of the contract call.

**Storage**

If we hold it in storage, that data will persist even after the function executes.String in solidity is actually technically not a value type.A string is actually an arrayof bytes.A variables of type string is actually a special type of array that we can append.

Because it's technically an object we've to decide where we want to store in memory or in storage.Since we only need name during execution, we can have it be string memory name.Then when we create this new Humans object, we'll create a new copy of 'x' variable into storage.

Memory means after execution delete this variable and storage means keep it forever.

Let's deploy and see what happens now:

![deployed_struct_array](/Images/Day3/c20.png)

We've this addBoys function and since we're making a state change, here we can see that this indeed is a orange button instead of being a blue button.

**Mappings**

What if I'm looking for a boy's age from his name in the array?

Mapping takes some type of key and spits out whatever variable it's mapped to.
In our case we want to find the age of the boy using his name.

![mapp_function](/Images/Day3/c21.png)

Let's deploy and see:

![map_function_deployed](/Images/Day3/c22.png)

**SPDX License**

Typically at the top of the contracts you want to add an SPDX license identifier.Basically solidity and ethereum community found out that trust in a smart contracts can be better established if source code is available and in terms of legality and copyright it just makes life alot easier if you add that license identifier right at the top of your solidity.

We're going to use MIT license identifier because it's the most open license out there.It means anybody can use this code and we don't care.

`//SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT`

**Deploying to a live network**

We now have a contract that we've decided that we liked.It got mappings, it enables us to actually store boys and their age.We've done all of our testing in this JavaScript VM and we've decided you know what we want to deploy this to an actual testnet or mainnet.

How do we actually deploy this so that other people can interact with this contract?

We're again going to use `Rinkeby Test Network` because that's what we use to make our first transaction.Now again you'll need some type of test ethereum in your test wallet.If you get lost you can always go to [rinkeby faucet](https://faucet.rinkeby.io/) or a better alternative would be to go to the link token contracts in the [chainlink documentation](https://docs.chain.link/docs/link-token-contracts/).

Only thing we need to change in remix is we need to change from JavaScript VM to Injected Web3 and metamask will actually pop up.

Injected Web3 means we're taking our metamask and injecting it into the source code of the browser.Web3 provider is if we want to use our own blockchain node or our own web3 provider.When we do injected web3 we're saying our web3 provider is our metamask will work perfectly for what we're trying to do.

If you deploy the contract into web3 provider, metamask will pop up asking if you want to do this transaction because remember we're deploying a contract we're changing the state of the blockchain,so we have to pay a little bit of gas fee for it.We get a link to the Rinkeby Etherscan similar to exactly what we saw before when we made a transaction.The difference here is that instead of sending ethereum to somebody, we're actually making a transaction on the blockchain to create a contract. After a short while it'll show up in status as success, the number of block confirmations which again is the number of blocks appended to block that included our transaction.

**Interacting with Deployed Contracts**

Same as working with the VM we've all the exact same functions in here.However if I click store button, metamask will pop up and do our transaction.

**EVM**

All the solidity code that we wrote and when we interacted with blockchain, all above solidity was compiled down to the EVM also known as `Ethereum Virtual Machine`.A lot of the blockchains out there  today are what's called `EVM compatible` which means that all the solidity and all the functions that we're created can still compile down to EVM and deployed on their blockchain.

You'll find out a little bit later when we look to work on a non-ethereum based chain that we can still deploy our solidity smart contracts to these other chains as well.

**Summary**

- First thing you always gotta do in your smart contract is name the solidity version then name a contract.
- Contract in solidity is like a class and defines all the functions and parameters of your contract.
- There are many different types in solidity like unsigned integer, boolean, bytes, string and more.
- We can create structs, arrays, mappings, functions in solidity.
- View functions don't make a state change.
- Memory and storage are two different ways to initialize where a variable is going to be saved.
- All the solidity code that we work with gets compiled down to EVM.



## **Lesson 2 - Storage Factory**

We've got our first contract out of the way.We're understanding some of the basics of solidity.Now let's move onward into a little bit more advanced with our smart contract and let's build "Factory Pattern" of smart contracts.

**Factory Pattern**

We have our SimpleStorage contract which allows us to store age and age associated with different people. What if though I wanna have a lot these SimpleStorage contracts deployed? I wanna give poeple the ability to generate and deploy their own lists based off the SimpleStorage contract.

This is where a Factory Pattern comes into play.

**New contract StorageFactory**

Let's go ahead and create a new contract called StorageFactory.sol in the same location where SimpleStorage file lies.SimpleStorage and StorageFactory needs to be in the same folder.

Let's figure out how to get a contract to actually deploy another contract.We're gonna add those basics pieces that we added in that SimpleStorage contract.

![basic_elem](/Images/Day4/d1.png)

**Import 1 contract into another**

So how can this contract deploy a SimpleStorage contract?

well first thing we're gonna do is actually import SimpleStorage into our StorageFactory contract.We need to import it so that our StorageFactory contract knows what a SimpleStorage contract even looks like.The way we can import it is:

![importing](/Images/Day4/d2.png)

Importing with that line is equivalent to copying everything in SimpleStorage.sol file and pasting it above in StorageFactory file.

It's interesting about having two contracts in the same file is that when you go to deploy, you'll actually have a choice of which one you want to deploy.

**Deploy a Contract from a Contract**

If we want this contract to be able to deploy a SimpleStorage contract we're of course have to create a function that can do that.

![genSS](/Images/Day4/d3.png)

We're going to create an object of type SimpleStorage contract, name it "genSS" which is going to be a new SimpleStorage contract.SimpleStorage contract takes no input parameters.

If we deploy this contract as is by going to our deploy tab, choosing the StorageFactory and deploying.
![deployedSS](/Images/Day4/d4.png)

We've the function that doesn't return anything.We're creating new contracts but can't really read where those contracts are being created.We'd have to look on a block explorer like Etherscan.

**Track simple storage contracts**

Let's make a way for us to keep track of all the different SimpleStorage contracts that we deploy.We put then in a list or an array.

![SSArray](/Images/Day4/d5.png)

We create a SimpleStorage contract array of visibility public and named it "SSArray".And Everytime we create SimpleStorage contracts, we'll add to our SSArray.

Let's see what happens when we deploy.

![deployedSSArray](/Images/Day4/d6.png)

We've blue button which stands for our SimpleStorage contract array.If I click createSSContract, I've created a transaction that's going to create a new SimpleStorage contract and push it onto our SSArray.If I try to access 0th index, I'll get the address as shown in above picture.This is the address that the SimpleStorage contract was deployed to.

We've successfully deployed a contract to the blockchain from another contract.

**Calling Store & Retrieve Functions from SF**

We can do more than just deploying the contracts.We can deploy contracts from another contract and call those functions as well.

Let's create a function where we call store function and retrieve function of SimpleStorage contract from StorageFactory contract.

![sfStore](/Images/Day4/d7.png)

The reason I'm chosing a index is because we're going to choose which SimpleStorage contract in our list that we want to interact with.Then we're also gonna pass a age to call on the store function(it takes age as a parameter) of SimpleStorage contract.

**Address & ABI**

Anytime that you interact with a contract you need two things.
- You need the address of the contract you wanna interact with.
- ABI (Application Binary Interface)

for us we figured that out that we're going to push and get the address from the SSArray.We can get the ABI from the import command.We'll go into ABI later.

In order for us to interact with SimpleStorage contract, we can just do:

![interactingSS](/Images/Day4/d8.png)

We created a SimpleStorage object (addSS) which stores the address of the contract that we wanna interact with.Then we pass the age by calling the method for that contract (same like in OOP) to store the age.

Let's see what happens when we deploy.

![deploysfStore](/Images/Day4/d9.png)

CreateSS contracts creates the contract and adds into our array "SSArray".
sfStore which stores an age to one of the contract present in SSArray.
SSArray shows the address of the contract.

**Adding Retrieve Function **

We can't see the age because we didn't add retrieve functionality.So let's add that.

![sfretrieve](/Images/Day4/d10.png)

index as a parameter is used to choose a contract on the SSArray and return it's age.Since we're only reading state so it's a view function.And we can return that object("addSS") retrieve method(like in OOP).

**Compiling**

If we compile above code and deploy SimpleFactory contract.We'll have sfRetrieve function which retrieves the age of the contract present in SSArray.

**Making the Code lil bit Simpler**

We can actually even refactor the code to be a little bit simpler.We don't need to save SimpleStorage contract address into it's object.We can directly call retrieve method and return that.Same goes for our sfStore too.

![simplercode](/Images/Day4/d11.png)

This is a way for us to actually deploy contracts and interact with contracts from another contract.

**Additional Note**

To deploy a contract we do need all the functionality of that contract imported.However to interact with the contract we don't need all of the functionality.We'll learn about interfaces in the next lesson which will allow us to actually interact with the contract without having all the functions defined.

**Inheritance**

SimpleStorage has got really cool functions and maybe I want all the functions inside StorageFactory.I want my StorageFactory to create SimpleStorage contracts  and I want it to be a SimpleStorage contract itself.

Well my StorageFactory can actually inherit all the functions of SimpleStorage without me having to copy paste all the functions and variables over to StorageFactory.

I could do solidity's version of Inheritance.

![inheritance](/Images/Day4/d12.png)

Just by doing that line of code, my StorageFactory contract now will have all of the functions and variables of SimpleStorage.

Let's deploy the inherited contract.

![deploy_inheritance](/Images/Day4/d13.png)

Not only do we have all the functions originally defined in our StorageFactory but we aditionally have all the functions from the SimpleStorage.

**Recap**

- We learned to import entire chunks of code from other files into our files.
- We learned how to do inheritance.
- We learned how to deploy contracts from another contract.
- We learned to interact with different contracts from outside of our contract.


## **Lesson 3 - Fund me**

Same as before we're going to create a .sol file.We're gonna name it FundMe.sol and same as last time we add SPDX license identifier.For this lesson we'll choose solidity version >=0.6.6 <0.9.0.Create contract called "FundMe" and gonna start working.

![fundme](/Images/Day5/e1.png)

**purpose of this contract**

We want this contract to be able to accept some type of payment.

**Payable function , wei , gwei & ether**

So let's create a new function that can accept payment.

![fundfunction](/Images/Day5/e2.png)

When we define function as `payable` which means that function is used to pay for things.Every single function call has an associated value with it.Whenever you make a transaction, you can always append a value.That value is how much `wei` or `gwei` or `finney` or `ether` you're gonna send with your function call or your transaction.

As we mentioned before `wei`, `gwei` and `ether` are just different ways to talk about how much ether you're gonna send.If we look at ethereum converter, it shows how much gwei equals to 1 eth.

![ethgwei](/Images/Day5/e3.png)

1 Wei is the smallest denomination of Ethereum.You can't break Ethereum into anything smaller than 1 wei.This is why when you're talking about how much something costs everything always defaults to wei.

Let's deploy the contract and see what it got.

![deployFundme](/Images/Day5/e4.png)

The button is red because it's a payable function.If I click fund button, I can add value associated with it.

![fundedValue](/Images/Day5/e5.png)

So what we want to do with this funding?What do we do when people send something?

Well Let's keep track of who sent us funding.We can create a new mapping between addresses and value.

![addressAmountFunded](/Images/Day5/e6.png)


**Mapping , msg. sender , msg.value**

In this fund function let's keep track of all the people who sent us money or all the addresses that sent us some value.To do this we can use some keywords that go along every transaction.

![msgSender](/Images/Day5/e7.png)

`msg.sender` and `msg.value` are keywords in every contract call and every transaction."msg.sender" is the sender of the function call and "msg.value" is how much they sent.

So whenever we call fund function, somebody can send some value cause it's a payable function.And we gonna save everything in this "addressAmountFunded" mapping.

Let's deploy the contract:

![deploy](/Images/Day5/e8.png)

We've a new view function "addressFundedAmount".

**Funding**

If I click directly fund, nothing gonna happen because my address is going to be sending zero.In order for me to send something, I've to add some value along with my transaction.So above we've send 1 gwei which is equal to 1000000000 wei.Before hitting fund let's copy the fake account address to retrieve the funded amount.We've called a fund function with a value of 1 gwei associated with it.If I call the addressFundedAmount with the same address, I can see how much I've funded this smart contract.We can even add more value.

When we send funds to our contracts this actually means that this contract wherever this is deployed, now is the owner of value of addressFundedAmount of ether.We now have a way to fund smart contracts.

**ETH -> USD /conversion**

In this smart contract, in this funding that we're doing we want to create a minimum value for people to be able to fund our endeavors which whatever they may be.We want to set some minimum value. Ether is great but for whatever reason we wanna work in USD or maybe in some other currency.

How are we going to get the conversion rate from that currency to a currency that we can use in this smart contract?

First thing that we're gonna need to do to set the value is to know what the Eth to USD conversion rate is because If I want to accept ethereum as the token but I want it in it's USD currency then I'm gonna need to know what that conversion rate is.  

**Deterministic problem & Oracle solution**

`So How are we going to get this data into smart contract? Where are we going to get this data from?`

Remember how we talked about blockchains being deterministic systems and oracles being a bridged between blockchains and the real world.Well this is exactly where oracle's come in.

When we're talking about these systems you know these blockchains they cannot connect to real world events.They can't connect to external systems.They can't do external computation.They're intentionally these deterministic systems.These walled gardens.In order for us to make the connection, we need a blockchain oracle.We need some type of network.

If you look at a blockchain, it can easily say 1 + 1 = 2 and every other node can easily verify this.However blockchain can't easily say let's all grab the same random number because each node is going to get a different random number.They also can't make an API call because if one node calls the API and at a different time another node calls it or specifically an http get, there could potentially get very very different results and if another node tries to replay these transactions by calling these API's again maybe 10 years in the future, there's a good chance that API is going to be depreciated and they could be hacked, malicious etc.

The other reason that blockchains are intentionally can't make an API calls because then they would be making assumptions about real world and layer1's typically don't want to have an opinion on any political or geopolitical issue.Whereas `oracle network` on the other hand can make those assumptions.

![DvsnD](/Images/Day5/e9.png)

**Centralized Oracles**

The other main thing we need to talk about here is centralized oracles being main points of failures.If you or I say "I'm just going to be a the oracle.I'm going to be the one to put this data on chain.", we now have this massive centralized point of failure.We've done all this work to make our decentralized computation decentralized and on chain but we ruin all the decentrality by having a single point of failure.Remember one of the whole purposes of blockchain is so that not a single entity can flip a switch and restrict our freedom to interact.

With a centralized oracle a single entity can flip a switch and restrict our freedom to interact with eachother.

![centralizedOracle](/Images/Day5/e10.png)

**Decentralized Oracle Networks**

We also need to get data from many different decentralized sources or do any type of computation in a decentralized manner.This is where chainlink really shines.

![decentralizedOracle](/Images/Day5/e11.png)

`Chainlink` is a modular decentralized oracle infrastructure and oracle network that allows us to get data and do external computation in a highly sybil resistant decentralized manner.

It can be as customizable as you want.As you can run with one node or many nodes or do as many nodes as you like.


**Chainlink Datafeeds**

Currently one of the most popular features of chainlink is their data feeds or their price feeds.We can even go check them out over [here](data.chain.link).

![chainlinkDatafeeds](/Images/Day5/e12.png)

![chainlinkDatafeeds2](/Images/Day5/e13.png)

We can see number of different price feeds and the networks that are providing the prices for these specific pricing powers.We can see above there's a whole number of decentralized different oracles returning data for different price feeds.This above one is ETH/USD and it's exactly the price view we're looking for.

Having a decentralized network bring the data on chain and have it as a reference point of difinitive truth allows users to all collaborate and use this common good and it'll be cheaper, more secure and more efficient than anybody even running their own centralized oracle.These price feeds are incredibly powerful.

Additionally they're being used by some of the top protocols in the defi system right now like synthetix is securing around 2 Billion $, sushi swap for leveraging trades, set protocol commodity money, ave for understanding the price of an underlying collateral.This is an example of an out of box decentralized solutions that's already been packaged in the decentralized manner for you to consume and for you to use.This makes going to production a thousand times easier than building everything yourself


**Chainlink Code documentation on ETH/USD**

However if you want to make API calls and build your own decentralized network, you absolutely can with the chainlink API calls.We're not going to go into that here because using chainlink pricefeeds, chainlink vrf, keepernetwork and all these other pre-box decentralized services are going to make going live and going mainnet a lot easier.

You can always make a chainlink http get call as well.We're not gonna go over this because putting this into production is a little bit tricker.

If you ever want to try them out by themselves, you can head [here](https://docs.chain.link/docs/get-the-latest-price/) and click "open in remix".It'll kick us to remix edition with all the code written for us.Let's go ahead and compile it and deploy it to real network(Injected Web3 in Environment).

The code is actually for 'Kovan network'.So switch your metamask to Koven.Grab [Koven faucet](https://faucets.chain.link/kovan) if you don't have any.Let's deploy the contract, metamask is gonna pop up and we can get the latest price by clicking the button.

We can see the function does indeed returns the latest price of the ethereum.You might be asking "Why this number look so big?"Remember how we talked about wei, gwei and either.Well the reason that those exist is because decimals don't work in solidity.We actually have to return a value that's multiplied by 10 to some number.

If we get a value of 261497384316, this value is actually 2614.97384316 * 10<sup>8</sup>.

Next question you might wanna ask is why did we work with this on a testnet? Why can't we do this on a local network? The answer to this is because there're no Chainlink nodes on a simulated JavaScript VMs.We'll learn later how to actually mock these interactions and mock a chainlink node returning data onto our blockchain.But for now let's head back over to the contract that we're working on so we can learn how to implement this latestprice in any contract that we ever want to.

**LatestRoundData**

Another contract called in this case called priceFeed has a function called latestRoundData which returns alot of data.

![latestRoundData](/Images/Day5/e14.png)

It returns a roundID which defines how many times this priceFeed has been updated, returns the price which is the actual conversion between two assets, returns a startedAt which defines when this was last updated, returns a timestamp and returns a answeredInRound.Don't worry about answerInRound for now.If you want to dive deeper into what these rounds mean and what answeredInRound means you can definately check out the [chainlink documentation](https://docs.chain.link/). 


**Importing Datafeed code from Chainlink NPM package**

How do we implement this data feed into our fundMe application?

First thing we actually need to do is import the chainlink code.

![chainlinkPriceFeed](/Images/Day5/e15.png)

As we know an import take whatever code you're importing and stick it at the top of your project.When we import from the "@chainlink/contracts", we're actually importing from the "@chainlink/contracts" npm package.We can see and read more about this repository [here]("https://www.npmjs.com/package").


**Interfaces**

If you follow that import path that we got from documentation, we'll end up on the file below.

![importedfile](/Images/Day5/e16.png)

It's what we call an interface.These contracts don't start with the contract keyword but start with interface keyword.The main difference is that you can see their functions aren't completed.They just have the function name and it's return type.

In our code here solidity doesn't natively understand how to interact with another contract.We've to tell solidity what functions can be called on another contract.This is where `interfaces` are actually going to come in.Similar to structs what we can do with interfaces to find a new type.


**ABI/Application Binary Interface**

Remember how we said before we talked a little bit about ABI.Interfaces actually compile down to ABI.It tells solidity what functions can be called on another contract.We need solidity to know what functions it can use and what functions it can call other contracts with.

Anytime you're going to interact with another contract in solidity or smart contract programming in general, you're going to need that contracts ABI.We'll go into what these ABI's looks like a little bit later.


**Interacting with an Interface Contract**

How do we work with interface contract?

To interact with an interface contract it's going to work the exact same way is interacting with struct or a variable.

Let's define a new function called getVersion and we're going to call the version function of interface on our contract.

![getVersion](/Images/Day5/e17.png)

The same way we define variables and structs, we define working with other contracts and interfaces.

![AVinitialization](/Images/DAy5/e18.png)

First thing we named is type which is AVI.Since we're inside of a contract, we're going to skip visibility and give the name "rate".Then we initialize a contract.How do we actually choose where to interact with the AVI contract?Well we pass the address of where the contract is located.

**Finding the Pricefeed Address**

In order to find where this ETH/USD pricefeed contract is located on the Rinkeby chain, we can look at the [ethereum price feeds](https://docs.chain.link/docs/ethereum-addresses/) chainlink documentation.It has a ton of different price feeds and even more not price feeds related data.Scroll to Rinkeby because on each different chain the contract address that has all the price feed information is going to be different.Scroll down and find ETH/USD.

Copy that address and pass it to AVI initialization.

`It's saying that we've a contract that has "AggregatorV3Interface" contract's function defined in the interface located at that address.`If that's true, we should be able to call "rate.version".

![callingRate](/Images/Day5/e19.png)

**Deploying**

Let's compile it and deploy it to testnet(Injected Web3 as Environment).`Remember that address is located on a actual testnet.On an actual network.`We'll learn later on how we can actually work with a simulated chain and work with these price feeds but that's much later in the journey.

![versionCall](/Images/Day5/e20.png)

We can see that the version of our aggregatorV3Interface is version 4.So we just made a contract call to another contract from our contract using an interface.This is why interfaces are so powerful because they're a minimalistic view into another contract.

**Getprice function**

This is great we've a getVersion function but this still isn't the function that we want.We want to call a getprice function which if we look at our interface, we can see there's a latestRoundData function that returns an answer.

Let's go ahead and make a function that calls getprice instead.

![getPrice](/Images/Day5/e21.png)

**Tuples**

This latestRoundData function returns five variables.So how do we actually work with that? 

![tuples](/Images/Day5/e22.png)

A tuple is a list of objects of potentially different types whose number is a constant at compile-time.We can define several variables inside tuples.

Since lastRoundData function returns five different values, we can also make out contract return those five values.That above is a syntax for getting a tuple.Although our compiler will give us some warnings, it's saying unused variables because we're not using them for anything.We'll come back to that.

Then we can pick the variables that we want to return. Answer is the rate so we return that.


**Typecasting**

But compiling the code gives an error.It says return type argument int256 is not implicitly convertible to expected type."Answer" is an int256 and we want to return uint256.How do we rectify this?

We can fix the error by typecasting.Integers in solidity are really easy to cast into eachother.We could just do:

![typecast](/Images/Day5/e23.png)

Now our compiler is happy.This getPrice function should return the latest price of Ethereum in terms of USD.

**Deploying**

Let's go ahead and deploy this contract.

![deployedGetPrice](/Images/Day5/e24.png)

We can know the rate of Ethereum in terms of USD is 2746.19432590 $.


**Clearing unused Tuple Variables & Deploying**

Let's clean up the function before we go up.As you can see one thing the compiler is complaining about is we've unused local variables but latesRoundData returns five different variables.How do we actually return the five variables but make our compiler happy with us?

We can actually return blanks for each one of the unused sections with commas in between eachother like:

![cleanedTuple](/Images/Day5/e25.png)


**Wei/Gwei Standard (Matching Units)**

Let's put everything into the gwei/wei standard.We saw that getPrice has 8 decimal places.However the smallest unit of measure, it has 18.So typically let's make everything have 18 decimals as well.You don't have to do this and it'll save some gas if you don't.We could do:

`return uint256(answer * 10000000000);`

**getting the price using Get conversion rate**

We've the price of Ethereum in USD.We could set the price of our funding function to anything that we want.For example let's say 50$.We could convert whatever value they send us to it's USD equivalent and see if it's greater than or less than 50$.

Let's make a new function that converts that value that they send to its USD equivalent.

![convertfunction](/Images/Day5/e26.png)

Let's test this out and see why we have to do one more thing?

![deployconvert](/Images/Day5/e27.png)

This seems like a really big number i.e 2746194325900.00000000.This says that 1gwei is equal to 2746194325900 in USD.The price of 1ETH is not even that much.The reason that's off is we've to divide by 100000000.Both ethPrice and fundedAmount has 10<sup>19</sup> tacked on to them.

![fixedconversion](/Images/Day5/e28.png)

**Safemath & Integer Overflow**

Since we're on the topic of math, let's talk briefly about some of the pitfalls of solidity especially when it comes to math.

Prior to solidity 0.8 if you added to the maximum size, a uint number could be wrap around the lowest number that it would be.For example:

if we add two uint8 number :
255 + uint8(1) = 0
255 + uint(100) = 99

This is because integer can actually wrap around once they reach their maximum cap.They basically reset.

This is something we need to watchout for when working with solidity.If we're doing multiplication on really big numbers, we can accidentally pass this cap.Luckily as a version 0.8 of solidity, it actually checks for overflow and it's defaults to check for overflow to increase readability of code even if that comes a slight increase of gas costs.

Just be aware if you're using a lower version that 0.8 you're going to have to do something to make up for this.

We could write whole bunch of code to check all of our math or we could just import "SafeMath" from another package.Similar to chainlink we can import SafeMath from tool called OpenZeppelin.

OpenZeppelin is a open source tool that allows us to use a lot of already pre-built contracts.

![SafeMath](/Images/Day5/e29.png)

**Libraries**

Libraries is similar to contracts, but their purpose is that they are deployed only once at a specific address and their code is reused.

Using keyword:
The directive using A for B; can be used to attach library functions (from the library A) to any type (B) in the context of a contract.

In this case we're attaching a SafeMath chainlink library to uint256 so that these overflows are automatically checked for.

This is for those of you who are familier with SafeMath and integer overflows and underflows.We're not going to be calling the functions that SafeMath provides us like div, add, mull all those functions.Simply because in 0.8 moving forward we no longer have to use those.We can just use regular operator like '+' & '-'.


**Setting Threshold**

We know have a way to get the conversion rate of whatever eth is sent and turn it into USD.Now we can set a threshold in terms of USD but how do we guarantee that whatever amount that the users send when they call fund is going to be atleast 50$.

First set the minimum value by:
![minUSD](/Images/USD/e30.png)


**Require statement**

Now that we have a minimum amount how do we actually make sure that this minimum amount is met in the value they send us?

We could do that by:

![require](/Images/Day5/e31.png)

When a function call reaches a require statement, it'll check the truthiness of whatever require you've asked.In our case the converted rate of msg.value needs to be greater than or equal to our minUSD.If they didn't send us enough ether then we're going to stop executing.    

**Revert**
If the converted rate of msg.value is less than 50$, we're going to stop executing.We're going to kick it out and revert the transactions.This means user gonna get their money back as well as any unspent gas and this is highly recommended.We can also add a revert error message.   

![revert](/Images/Day5/e32.png)


**Deplying & Transaction**

Let's go and deploy the contract.If I try to fund less than 50$, below error message will be displayed.

![revertdeployed](/Images/Day5/e33.png)

The contract isn't even letting us to make the transaction.Whenever you see gas estimation failed errors usually that means something reverted or you didn't do something that was required.


**Withdraw Function**

Now we can fund this contract with a certain minimum USD value.You'll notice though that right now we don't do anything with this money.We're going to fund this contract however that's it and we don't have a function in here to actually withdraw the money.There's no way even though we just sent this contract some money.There's no way for us to get it back.How do we fix this?We could add a withDraw function.

![withDraw](/Images/Day5/e34.png)

This is also going to be a payable function because we're going to be transferring eth.

**Transfer , Balance , This**

![transfer](/Images/Day5/e35.png)

Transfer is a function that we can call on any address to send eth from one address to another.In this case we're transferring ethereum to msg.sender.We're going to send all the money that's been funded.So to get all the money that's been funded, we did `address(this).balance`

this is a keyword in solidity.Whenever you refer to "this", we're about contract that you're currently in and when we add address of this we're saying we want the address of the contract that we're currently in.

Whenever we call an address and then the balance attribute, you can see the balance in ether of a contract.So with that line we're saying whoever called the withdraw function because whoever calls the function is going to be a msg.sender transfer them all of our money.

**Deploying**

Let's fund the transaction with lots of ether.We fund it with one whole ether, hit the fund button and we're sending 1 whole ether into this contract.If we look at our balance it's will get down by 1 ether.Let's try to get it back.If we call withdraw function, once the transaction goes through we should get all of our ether back.


**Owner , Constructor Function**

Maybe we don't want anybody to be able to withdraw all the funds in this contract.We want only the funding admin to be able to withdraw funds so how do we set this up in a way that only the contract owner can actually withdraw funds?

Well we learned before that the require function can actually stop contracts from executing unless some certain parameters are met.We can do the same thing here with:

`require msg.sender = owner`

But we don't have an owner to this contract yet.How do we get an owner to this contract the instant that we deploy it?

We could have a function called createOwner but what happens if somebody calls this function right after we deploy it then we wouldn't be the owner anymore.

So we need a function to get called the instant we deploy this smart contract and that's exactly what the constructer does.So typically at the top of your smart contracts, you'll see a constructor and this is a function that gets called the instant your contact gets deployed.

![constructor](/Images/Day5/e36.png)

**Deploying**

Let's deploy the contract now.We can see our address as the owner of the contract.

After we've owner, we can go to withDraw function and set the require statement.

![requireOwner](/Images/Day5/e37.png)

After we deploy again, if the contract has same address that deploy to withdraw, only then it'll successfully withdraw.


**Modifiers**

We can now require this withdraw function is only callable by the owner.Now What if we have a ton of contracts that want to use `require(msg.sender == owner)`?IS there an easier way to wrap our functions and some require or some other executable?

This is where modifiers come in.We can use modifiers to write in the definition of our function, add some parameter that allows it to only be called by our admin contract.

Modifiers are used to change the behaviour of a function in a declarative way.Let's create our first modifier:

![modifiers](/Images/Day5/e38.png)

What a modifier is going to do is before we run the function do the require statement first and then wherever your underscore is in the modifier run the rest of the code.

Now what we can do is make the withDraw function as admin.What's gonna happen is before we do the transfer, we're actually gonna check the modifier which runs the msg.sender == owner. 

![withdrawadmin][/Images/Day5/e39.png]


**Deploying**

Let's deploy the contract in JavaScript VM, we can call withDraw from the address of the deployed account only.


**Resetting the Funders Balances to Zero**

The only thing that we're really missing is that when we withdraw from the contract, we're not updating our balances of people who funded this?So even after with we withdraw this is always gonna be the same.We need to go through all the funders in this mapping and reset their balances to zero but how do we actually do that?


**For loop**

We can actually loop through all the keys in a mapping.When a mapping is initialized, every single key is essentially initialized.We obviously can't go through every single possible key on the planet.However we can create another data structure called "Array".

Let's go and create a funders array that way we can loop through them and reset everyone's balance to zero.


**Summary**

- Right away when we deploy this we're set as owner.
- We can allow anybody to fund.
- They have to fund it with minimum USD value that we actually set.
- Whenever they fund we keep track of how much they're funding and who's been funding us.
- We can get the price of Ethereum that they send in the terms of USD.
- We can convert it and check to see if they're sending us the right amount.
- We have our admin modifier so that we're the only ones who can withdraw from the contract.
- When we do withdraw everything from the contract, we reset all the funders who have currently participated in our crowdsourcing application.


**Deploying & Transaction**

Let's see if everything works end to end.If we fund 0.1 eth to the contract, and we look at the 0th index of funders, we'll see the address that funded the contract.Even other account could fund the contract.

**Forcing a Trasacttion**

Let's try to be malicious.Let's have another account withdraw all the funds in here.If another account clicks withdraw function, the transaction will fail.We're relentlessly malicious we want to send the transaction regardless so even though I'm not the admin of the contract I've gone ahead and still tried to send those withdrawl.So what happens now?

We'll see remix saying something went wrong.


## **Python**
We've been working with remix so far to start our smart contract in our solidity development journey.Remix is an incredibly powerful web IDE .Remix should always be the starting ground for anybody looking to start their smart contract journey because it's a wonderfully friendly way to really show what's going on behind the scenes and it's easy to see everything we're doing with ethereum, chainlink and our smart contracts.

**Limitations of Remix**

- Can't integrate other parts of a project.
- Limited support for tests or custom deployments.
- Can't save files locally without a plugin.
- Any custom functionality requires a plugin.
- Needs an internet connection.
- Doesn't have python.

In order for us to deploy, test and automate everything about our smart contract development cycle, we want to connect our solidity and our smart contracts with more traditional programming language like python.This way we can customize our entire development environment in any way we like.

First we'll learn to work with `web3.py` which is an incredibly powerful python package for doing everything we wanna do with smart contracts.After we learn some basics of web3.py, we'll move on to `brownie` which is a smart contract development framework built on top of web3.py which makes our life even easier.However it's really important to learn web3.py because this will teach us what's going behind the scenes of brownie.

**VScode , Python , Solidity Setup**

For the rest of the journey I'm going to be working with visual studio code which is an incredibly powerful text editor that will give us a lot of formatting and a lot of really nice tools to work with deploying and interacting with our smart contracts.

You can download VScode [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

extensions to installed:
- python3
- solidity

**VScode features**

One of the amazing things about VScode is you can actually open a terminal up inside a visual studio code. You can go over to the top bar to terminal and select new terminal.

You can actually hit `ctrl` + `(backtick)` to toggle back and forth between having terminal open and closing it.

**Testing python install & Troubleshooting**

We can test in terminal to see if python is installed correctly.If we type `python --version`, you should get something like:

![python_version](/Images/Day6/f1.png)

If it doesn't work you can look for troubleshoot in google.Whatever the error you've, you'll get a link which will lead you to the answer.

**Creating a new folder**

In our terminal we can create some folder.You can create one by doing:

`mkdir folder_name`

and to go inside the folder:

`cd folder_name/`



**SimpleStorage. sol**

We'll be working with SimpleStorage again the exact same contracts but instead we're going to be using web3.py.

We want our visual studio to know that we're in the folder where we wanna work.We can click files icon, click open folder and open the folder that you wanna work in.

**Remember to save**

Now the file is in VScode, we can see we've little dot here.

![vs_dot](/Images/Day6/f2.png)

Whenever you see that dot, it means that your VScode file isn't saved.We wanna always save it otherwise when we compile, things might not work correctly.

We can see there's line under pragma.It's VScode way of telling there's an error at this position.This is just the extension being a little bit confused.We can safely ignore this but if it's really bothersome you can:

`right click it and do something like solidity change global compiler version` or 
`go to perferences then settings.Type solidity and change the remote compile version to 6.0.6`

Also we wanna fave format on save as checked.This allows to format our code whenever we save the code.

**Python Formatter & settings**

First thing we're gonna do is installed a black python formatter.To install it type this command in terminal:

`pip install black`

search for python formatting and set formatting provider to 'black'.

**Author's recommended Settings**

It's highly recommended to have both format on save for both python and solidity. 

**working with python**

Let's go ahead and create a new file and we'll call it deploy.py.

**Reading our solidity file in python**

First thing we wanna do is read SimpleStorage solidity file.We need to get the solidity file into deploy scripts so that our python file knows what it's going to deploy.

![reading_file](/Images/Day6/f3.png)

**Keyboard Shortcuts**

To look at keyboard shortcut's you could hit `ctrl` + `p`, add `>` type `keybord shortcut references` to see all the shortcuts reference.It'll bring to the keyboard reference page based off of what OS you've.

**Py-Solc-x**

Now that we can actually read from our SimpleStorage.sol file we actually have to compile it because back in remix every single time we did anything with our files, we'd to compile them first.We need some compiler in python.Luckily there's a fantastic python package called `Py-Solc-x`You can install it by:

`pip install py-solc-x`

**Importing solcx**

The way we can use it is by importing it into our python file.

![importing_solcx](/Images/Day6/f4.png)

**Compiled_sol**

We're going to save our compiled code to compiled_sol variable.

![compile_sol](/Images/Day6/f5.png)

We're not gonna go too deep into what's this settings and output selection are actually doing but if you want to learn more you can go to the homepage of [pysolcx documenation](https://solcx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

You'll see we get the massive object which has whole bunch of basically unreadable pieces but that are the low level code that actually gets compiled whenever we use the compiler in remix or in python.

Remix actually does the exact same thing.Once we compile our contract, you can actually copy the byte code.You'll see whole bunch of stuff.There's also a `opcode` which are low level code that the contract are actually doing that actually governs how the code works.

You'll also see ABI which we're gonna output in our deploy.py.If you copy and past the ABI in new file, you'll see long json object.It explains all the functions and variables.It's a lowest digestible way to say here's where all the functions are,here's what the parameters types are, return type gonna be and everything like that.

**Saving Compiled Code/writing**

![json_dump](/Images/Day6/f6.png)

This takes our compiled_sol json variable and dump it into the `compiled_code.json` file.It's going to keep it in the json syntax.

**Deploying in Python (Bytecode , ABI)**

We've compiled our solidity and stored our solidity code to compiled_code.json file.Now we probably want to deploy it and test it out.So how do we actually do it?

First we actually get the byte code.We need the bytecode of the file so that we can actually deploy it.

![bytecode](/Images/Day6/f7.png)

Now that we have out byte code we also need ABI.

![abi](/Images/Day6/f8.png)

Now we've two main pieces to deploy, all we've to do is deploy.

**Which Blockchain/Where to deploy**

The question that becomes is where are we gonna deploy it to.Which blockchain are we going to deploy to?In remix when we're first playing around, we're using a JavaScript VM, we absolutely could and we'll learn to deploy to a testnet because that's going to be the same way that we're going to deploy to a mainnet.But before we do that we should learn how to deploy on a simulated environment.

**Ganache Chain**

This is where `Ganache` going to come to the rescue.Ganache is a simuated blockchain that we can actually use to deploy our smart contracts to and have it interact like it's a real blockchain.Ganache is going to allow us to spin up our own local blockchain.

You can download Ganache from [here](https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/).

![ganache](/Images/Day6/f9.png)

User interface is really nice because it allows us to do one click blockchain or create our own local blockchain.That means this blockchain isn't connected to any other blockchain out there but it'll act like a blockchain and will be lot faster than us having to interact with a testnet and we control the entire blockchain because it's only one node.Ganache is our JavaScript VM.

**Ganache UI**

We go ahead and click quickstart which will automatically upload and get started with our own local fake blockchain.

![ganacheUI](/Images/Day6/f10.png)

You can even see it gives us some accounts.Each one of these addresses has a private key.In your ganache if you click key, it'll show key.

Let's learn how to connect to this ganache blockchain from the UI first and then we'll learn how to do the command line version.

**Introduction to Web3. py**

This is when we finally start working with web3.py.we just do below command in VScode terminal:

`pip install web3`

Now we can start working with web3.py.

![web3importing](/Images/Day6/f11.png)

**Http/Rpc provider**

To connect the contract to blockchain we choose http provider.If we look at ganache instance, we've rpc server which has the url HTTP://127.0.0.1:7545.This is the url that we're going to use to connect to this blockchain.In remix we're actually using our metamasks directly to connect to the blockchain.However we wanna connect directly to our simulated blockchain.

**Connecting to Ganache(RPC server,Documentation,Chain ID,address,Privatekey)**

![connectingGanache](/Imges/Day6/f12.png)

With everything that we show you, you probably going to want to get really familier with the documentation because even after being a pro, you're going to want to use it more and more and more if you want to learn about other providers.You can go to providers page of the documentation. 

The next thing that we always gonna need is `chain id` or `network id`.What is the id of the blockchain? For ganache it's 5777.We also need address.We can grab fake address to work with.

![conectingGanache2](/Images/Day6/f13.png)

Similar to how in remix when we working with the JavaScript VM we're given a bunch of fake addresses.We're doing the same thing but with ganache.Then we also want our private key.We need the private key to sign our transactions.


Whenever you add a private key in python, you need to add `0x` to the front.Python is always gonna look for the hexadecimal version of the private key.

Now we've all the parameters we need for interacting with and connecting to our ganache local chain.

**Deploy to Ganache**

It's time to finally deploy our SimpleStorage.sol contract.Let's do it.So the credit contract that we're going to deploy with web3.py.

![deployContract](/Images/Day6/f14.png)

Does this mean we've deployed it ?Well no this just means we've a contract now.We've created a contract object.

How do we actually deploy this?

**Building a Transaction**

we need to actually build our transaction because again whenever we interact with the blockchain, whenever we make a state change and in our case we'd be deploying a contract we're going to make a state change So we need :
- Build the contract deploy transaction
- Sign the transaction
- Send the transaction

To do all that we need to talk about `Nonce` thing.

**Nonce**

Remember way back in our blockchain demo when we used a nonce to solve the answer to that really difficult mining problem.Well defination of nonce is just a word coined or used for just one occasion and in cryptography it's an arbitrary number that can be used just once in a cryptographic communication.The nonce that is used to find the answer is going to be different from another nonce that we're actually gonna need to make our transaction.

If we look at our metamask, look at our activity and look at one of the transactions we've made recently on etherscan, we can see nonce here as well.

![transaction_nonce](/Images/Day6/f15.png)

This nonce is the number of transaction that our account has actually made.Everytime we make another transaction, our transaction is hashed with a new nonce.This is what going on behind the scenes with our transaction and we need this to send our transaction.

**Getting Nonce**

We can actually get our nonce by just grabbing our latest transaction count

 ![getting_nonce](/Images/Day6/f16.png)
 
We'll get our ans as 0 if we print the nonce because on our local blockchain the address we're using hasn't been used before.

**Create a Transaction**

Let's create a transaction object.

![creating_transaction](/Images/Day6/f17.png)

As you might have pointed out our SimpleStorage.sol doesn't actually have a constructor.Every contract technically has a constructor.In our case it's just blank.We're not telling our SimpleStorage.sol to do anything.

**Transaction Parameters**

In web3.py we need to give atleast a  couple of parameters.We always have to give `chainId`, `from` and `nonce`.

If we print the transaction, we could see even more parameters.We have `value` which is the ether that we're going to send, `gas`, `gasPrice` which we can arbitrarily set if we'd like, `chainId`, `from`, `nonce`, `data` and `to` which is just empty because it's sending it to the blockchain.

The giant data object there is encompassing everything that's happening in SimpleStorage.sol.

**Signing Our Transaction(signed_txn)**

This is just a transaction and anybody could actually send the transaction as long as it's signed by them.So we've the transaction but we need to sign it from somebody.Since we're sending it from our address, our private key is going to be the only key that's going to work to sign the transaction.

Remember when we were talking about public private keys, we right now have a message that is defining how to deploy SimpleStorage but it's not signed yet.So we're gonna need to use our private key to sign it to create unique message signature that we're the only ones that can create the private key but anybody else can verify it was us who signed it.

![signing_transaction](/Images/Day6/f18.png)

If you encounter the following error:
- [Transaction must not include unrecognized fields](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70458501/typeerror-transaction-must-not-include-unrecognized-value-solidity-python)
- [ValueError: Method eth_maxPriorityFeePerGas not supported](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70104101/valueerror-method-eth-maxpriorityfeepergas-not-supported-web3-py-with-ganache)

**Never Hardcode your Private keys**

It's a really bad practice if you push the code to source or github.Somebody else can see your private key and steal all your funds.So we don't wanna hard code our private keys in our code like we're doing here.

Let's take this time to talk about environment variables and how to set them.

**Environment variables**

Environment variables are variables that can set and then we set in our terminal and in our command lines.Following is a way to set an environment variables in MacOS and Linux only.Don't worry we'll show a way to make an environment variable in windows as well.

You can set an environment variable by running something like:
`export PRIVATE_KEY = 0x63b38f9ed50c65b9e48595d8a4b0e398559d2317d3d20ff05162895e4b6ef547`

Now if you type `echo $PRIVATE_KEY`, it'll display the private key.

Setting environment variables with windows the process that we're going to do is actually a little bit different.You can check this [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqWDiu8a4gc&t=40s&ab_channel=Twilio) for setting a environment variable in windows.

**Limitations of Exporting  Environment Variables**

It's important to note that this export method we're doing here for creating a environment variables only works for the duration that our shell is live.If we were to close out of our shell and then reopen it, our environment variable that we set would be gone.We'd have to re-run that export command. 

We're gonna show you a way to set environment variables so that you don't have to keep doing that.

It's also not great to have in a plain text on your computer.However it's alot better than hard coding it into our script.

**Private key PSA**

Remember if you're using an account that has real money in it which I highly recommend you don't do, don't send this environment variable or private key or any of the code anywhere because then people can steal all of your funds.Once we move to brownie we'll show you more effective way for private key management but for now be cautious here.If you've followed along and set up a brand new account that has no real money and only test that money in it then great who cares because it's test and fake money anyways.

**Accessing Environment Variables**

We can actually access the environment variable in Python.To create an evn variable:

`export PRIVATE_KEY="your_private_key_without_double_quote"`

to view the key
`echo $PRIVATE_KEY`

to retrieve using python:

**.env file, .gitignore, pip install python-dotenv **

Other thing we can do is create a `.env` file.A .env is typically where people store environment variables.It's important to not push this to source if this is what you're going to do.In this .env file in python, we could do:

`export PRIVATE_KEY="0xyour_private_key_without_double_quote"`

If you're going to do this way always set .gitignore and make sure .env is in there.This will help make it harder for you to accidentally push your .env folder or file to github.

**load_dotenv()**

Python actually has a way of loading directly from a .env file without having to export on our environment variables or run source.env or export or really anything.We can do it with python.env package.

If we close our shell and reopen it, run echo and the saved variable we'll get none.If you run python deploy.py, it's print none as our private key.However we can use `dotenv` to pulled it directly from our .emv.We could do:

`pip install python-dotenv`

load_dotenv() looks for .env file and automatically imports it into our scripts.
