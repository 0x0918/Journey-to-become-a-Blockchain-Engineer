**Bitcoin**

`Bitcoin` was one of the first protocol to use this revolutionary technoloy called `Blockchain`.Bitcoin's white paper was released by the sudo anonymous `Santoshi Nakamoto` and it outlined how bitcoin can be used to make peer to peer transactions in a decentralized network.This network is powered by `Cryptography`.It allows people to engage in censorship resistant finance in a decentralized manner.Due to some of the features of bitcoin a lot of people took it as a superior store of value over another asset like gold.That's why it is commonly referred to as digital gold.Similar to gold there's a scarce and set amount of it on the planet and people use it to buy and sell similar to other assets.You can read more about the original vision in the [white paper](https://bitcoinwhitepaper.co/).


**Ethereum**

Some people saw this technology and thought that they could do even more.A few years later a man named `Vitalik Buterin` released a white paper describing a new protocol called Ethereum which used the same blockchain infrastructure but with an additional feature and in 2015 they released this project called `Ethereum`.Him and a number of others co-founders took this blockchain technology and applied it in ways that people can make entirely decentralized applications, decentralized organizations and build smart contracts and engage in agreements without a third-party intermediary or centralized governing force.Their idea was to take the same pieces that made bitcoin great and add smart contracts to it.Technically this was not even a new idea.Back in 1994, a man names Nick Zabo proposed a technology called `Smart Contracts`.


**Smart Contracts**

A Smart Contract is a self executing set of instructions that is executed without a third party intermediary.They come to life on a blockchain and these smart contracts are really going to be a core thing that we're going to be working with and we're going to be developing.Smart contracts are similar to regular traditional contracts that people make between eachother but instead of writing these contracts down on pen and paper or typing that on the computer, it's entirely written in code.The terms of the agreement are written in code and automatically executed by the decentralized blockchain network.This is the main differentiators between the Ethereum protocol and the Bitcoin protocol.


**Bitcoin Vs Ethereum**

Technically Bitcoin also has smart contracts however they're not `touring complete`: they don't have the full range of capabilities as a turing complete application like ethereum.This is actually an intentional move by bitcoin developers.They view the bitcoin network as a asset whereas the ethereum and ethereum developers viewed that asset as an asset and also as a utility for people to build these smart contracts.These smart contracts are revolutionary technologies but they actually come with a fatal flaw with what's know as `The Oracle Problem`.


**Oracle Problem & Solution**

These blockchains are deterministic systems and we'll learn very soon.This determinism means they are a walled guarded meaning that everything that happens in these smart contracts and on this blockchain happens in this little box.Now ofcourse if you want these smart contracts to actually be these digital superior agreements then they need some way to interact with the real world and get real data and external outside the blockchain computation.This is where `oracles` come into play.Oracles are the devices that bring data into a blockchain or execute sometype of external computation.Great so oracles are the solution.Now blockchain can talk to real world right? Well not quite.Our blockchains and smart contracts are these decentralized applications and in order for them to stay decentralized that means they also need to get their data and external computation from a decentralized manner as well.Your on-chain logic will be decentralized on the blockchain but you'll also need your off-chain data and your external computation decentralized as well.


**Hybrid Smart Contracts**

Combining on-chain logic settlement layers and these off-chain data and external computation builds are called `Hybrid Smart Contracts`.A large majority of `defi applications` in the largest applications today are these hybrid smart contracts.This is where protocol chain link comes into play.


**Chainlink**

`Chain link` is a decentralized modular oracle network that allows you to bring data into your smart contracts and do external computation and these hybrids smart contracts can have this on-chain settlement and interact with the real world in some meaningful way.Chain link is an incredibly powerful oracle network because it allows us to get data, get randomness, do some type of update or really customise our smart contracts in any way we want and elevate them to do anything that we want them to do.


**Importance of Ethereum**

Decentralized application is usually a combination of several smart contracts.Smart contracts are going to be what we code, write and deploy for the majority in this lesson.The ethereum protocol has given rise to many new paradigms and industries including `DEFI`, `NTFs`, `DAOs`(decentralized autonomous organizations) , `Layer2` and more.A couple of other protocol have taken this ethereum vision and gone in a different direction with it like polygon, polka dot or avalanche.If we learn the core basics of smart contract development on the ethereum platform all these skills translate to these other chains as well.

There're some smart contracts platform aka blockchains that don't use solidity however learning fundamental skills here will still translate to every single other blockchain.

**Chainlink features**

Chainlink is the most popular and powerful decentralized oracle network and is going to be the one we're going to focus on here.Chainlink is also blockchain and smart contract platform agnostic meaning it'll work on Ethereum, Avalanche, Polygon, Polkadot or really any blockchain or smart contract platform out there.

**Summary**

- Bitcoin was the first one to take blockchain mainstream
- Bitcoin is like a digital gold.
- Ethereum allows for smart contracts.
- Chainlink provides data and external computation to smart contracts.
- Hybrid smart contracts combine on-chain and off-chain computations.
